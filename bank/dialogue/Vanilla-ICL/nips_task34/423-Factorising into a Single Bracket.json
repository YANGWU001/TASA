That\u2019s perfectly okay\u2014recognising a gap is the first step toward closing it!  \n\nFactorising a quadratic like  \n\n\\[\nx^{2}+10x+25\n\\]\n\nmeans rewriting it as the product of **one** binomial (a \u201csingle bracket\u201d) multiplied by itself (or by another binomial). In other words we are looking for numbers *a* and *b* such that  \n\n\\[\nx^{2}+10x+25 = (x + a)(x + b).\n\\]\n\nBecause the expression is a perfect square, the two numbers will be the same (\u202f*a = b*\u202f).  \n\n**How to find them**\n\n1. **Identify the constant term** (the number without *x*). Here it is **25**.  \n2. **Find two numbers whose product is 25** and whose sum is the coefficient of the *x* term (**10**).  \n   - The factor pairs of 25 are (1,\u202f25) and (5,\u202f5).  \n   - Only the pair **5\u202f+\u202f5 = 10** matches the required sum.  \n3. **Write the binomial using that number**:  \n\n\\[\nx^{2}+10x+25 = (x+5)(x+5) = (x+5)^{2}.\n\\]\n\nSo the correct factorisation is **\\((x+5)^{2}\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nNow try applying the same steps on a new expression.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,x^{2} - 14x + 49\\,}\n\\]\n\n**Your task**\n\n",
