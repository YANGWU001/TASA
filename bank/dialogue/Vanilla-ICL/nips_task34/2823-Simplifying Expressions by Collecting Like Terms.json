Numbers that have no variable are their own group.  Then we add or subtract the coefficients (the numbers in front of the variables) within each group.\n\nFor the example we gave you:\n\n> \u201cYou have **3x** stickers, then you find **5** more stickers. Later you give away **2x** stickers and **\u03c0** stickers.\u201d\n\nThe expression we want to simplify is  \n\n\\[\n3x + 5 \\;-\\; 2x \\;-\\; \\pi .\n\\]\n\n1. **Group the *x* terms:**\u202f\\(3x\\) and \\(-2x\\) are \u201clike terms.\u201d  \n   \\(3x - 2x = (3-2)x = 1x\\).\n\n2. **Group the constant (no\u2011variable) terms:**\u202f\\(5\\) and \\(-\\pi\\) are \u201clike terms.\u201d  \n   \\(5 - \\pi\\) stays as it is because \\(\\pi\\) is an irrational constant; we just write it as \\(5-\\pi\\).\n\n3. **Write the simplified result:**  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x + (5-\\pi)} \\quad\\text{or simply}\\quad x + 5 - \\pi .\n\\]\n\nSo the correct simplification would be **\\(x + 5 - \\pi\\)**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nNow let\u2019s try another one.

The number `5` is a constant term and is not combined with the `x`\u2011terms.\n\n**How to solve it**\n\n1. **Identify** the like\u2011term groups (all the `x`\u2011terms together, all the constant terms together, etc.).  \n2. **Add or subtract** the coefficients of each group.  \n3. **Write the simplified expression** with one term for each group.\n\nIf we applied those steps to `3x + 5 \u2013 2x`, we would combine the `x`\u2011terms: `3x \u2013 2x = 1x`, and then keep the constant `5`. The simplified result is `x + 5`.\n\nNow that you see the process, let\u2019s try another one.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Simplify the expression by collecting like terms:**\n\n\\",

This tells us exactly where to focus our attention: the process of **collecting like terms**.\n\n**What does \u201ccollecting like terms\u201d mean?**  \nWhen an algebraic expression contains several terms, some of them have the same variable part (the same letters raised to the same powers). Those are *like terms*. By adding or subtracting the coefficients (the numbers in front of the variables), we can combine them into a single term. This makes the expression shorter and easier to work with.\n\n**Typical steps**\n\n1. **Identify** all terms that have the same variable part (e.g.,\u202f\\(x\\),\u202f\\(2x\\),\u202f\\(x^2\\),\u202f\\(xy\\), etc.).  \n2. **Group** those like terms together.  \n3. **Add or subtract** the coefficients.  \n4. **Rewrite** the expression with the combined terms.\n\nYou\u2019ll get plenty of practice with the next question, and we\u2019ll walk through each step together if you\u2019d like.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question\n\n**Simplify the following expression by collecting like terms:**\n\n\\[\n3a - 5b + 2a + 7b - 4c + 9c - a\n\\]\n\n*Hint:* Start by writing the expression so that all the \\(a\\)-terms are together, then the \\(b\\)-terms, then the \\(c\\)-terms. Add the numbers in front of each group.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type the simplified expression (e.g., \u201c\\(5a + 2b - 3c\\)\u201d).
