For example, the square of 6 is \\(6^2 = 6 \\times 6 = 36\\). |\n| **Cube** of a number *n* | Multiply the number by itself three times: *n\u202f\u00d7\u202fn\u202f\u00d7\u202fn* | Write it as \\(n^3\\). For example, the cube of 4 is \\(4^3 = 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64\\). |\n\nSo the correct answers to the practice question would be:\n\n1. Square of 6 \u2192 **36**  \n2.

What is the **square** of 8?\u2003\u2003______  \n2. What is the **cube** of 3?\u2003\u2003______  \n\n**Optional hint:**  \n- For the square, multiply the number by itself once (e.g., \\(8 \\times 8\\)).  \n- For the cube, multiply the number by itself twice (e.g., \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3\\)).  \n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get!
