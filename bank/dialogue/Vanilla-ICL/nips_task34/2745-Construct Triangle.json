Using only a ruler (or a straightedge) and a compass, construct a triangle whose side lengths are these three numbers.\n\n---\n\n### What you need to do\n\n1. **Draw the base**  \n   - Place the 9\u202fcm string (or draw a 9\u202fcm segment) on your paper. Call the endpoints **A** and **B**.\n\n2. **Locate the third vertex**  \n   - With the compass set to **5\u202fcm**, place the pointy end on **A** and draw an arc.  \n   - Without changing the compass width, set it to **7\u202fcm**, place the pointy end on **B**, and draw a second arc.  \n   - The two arcs will intersect at a point\u2014call it **C**. (If you get two intersection points, choose either one; they will give you the same triangle reflected.)\n\n3. **Complete the triangle**  \n   - Draw straight lines **AC** and **BC**.\n\n4. **Check your work**  \n   - Measure each side with the ruler to confirm they are 5\u202fcm, 7\u202fcm, and 9\u202fcm.  \n   - Verify that the three lengths satisfy the triangle inequality (the sum of any two sides is greater than the third).  \n\n---\n\n### Why this is a good practice\n\n- It reinforces the **construction steps** (base, arcs, intersection).  \n- It lets you practice **using the compass** with two different radii.  \n- It gives you a chance to **check your result** by measuring, which helps you spot mistakes early.\n\nGive it a try, and let me",
