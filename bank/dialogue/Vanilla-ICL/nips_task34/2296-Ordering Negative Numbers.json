The important thing is to keep trying and use a strategy you\u2019re comfortable with. Below is a quick reminder of the key idea:\n\n- On the number line, **the more negative a number is, the **farther left** it lies, so it is *smaller* (or \u201cless\u201d) than numbers that are less negative.**  \n- Conversely, a number that is **closer to zero** (e.g.,\u202f\u20112) is **greater** than a number that is farther from zero (e.g.,\u202f\u20117).\n\n**Try this short \u201cmental\u201d check:**  \n1. Write the numbers on a piece of paper.  \n2. Imagine a number line from left (very negative) to right (positive).  \n3. Place each number where it belongs; the left\u2011most is the *least* (smallest) and the right\u2011most is the *greatest* (largest).  \n\nNow let\u2019s practice with a new problem.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question\n\n**Order the following integers from **least (smallest) to greatest (largest)**:**\n\n\\[\n-3,\\; -12,\\; -1,\\; -8,\\; -5\n\\]\n\n**Steps to solve (you can follow these if you need a reminder):**\n\n1. Identify the number with the greatest absolute value (the farthest from zero). That one will be the most negative, so it goes first.  \n2. Continue moving toward zero, placing each remaining number in order of decreasing negativity.  \n3. The number closest to zero (but still negative) will be last in the list.\n\nWrite your answer in a single line, separated by commas, like: \\(-12, -8, -5, -3, -1\\).\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type your ordered list.
