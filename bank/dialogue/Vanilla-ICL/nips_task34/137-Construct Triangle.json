Draw a line segment\u202fAB that is 6\u202fcm long.  \n2. At point\u202fA, construct a 45\u00b0 angle opening away from segment\u202fAB.  \n3. On the ray of this 45\u00b0 angle, mark point\u202fC so that\u202fAC\u202fis 8\u202fcm long.  \n4. Connect points\u202fB\u202fand\u202fC\u202fto complete triangle\u202fABC.\n\nOnce you have finished, check that:\n- AB = 6\u202fcm,\n- AC = 8\u202fcm,\n- \u2220BAC = 45\u00b0.\n\n*Tip:* If you need help remembering how to construct a specific angle with a compass, think about creating an isosceles triangle with the desired angle at its vertex.
