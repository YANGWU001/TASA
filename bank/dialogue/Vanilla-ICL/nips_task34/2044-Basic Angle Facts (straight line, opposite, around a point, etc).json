Vertically opposite angle \u2026 I think the angle that\u201d** but didn\u2019t finish the statement or give a numeric measure.  \n\n- **What you got right:** You identified that the problem involves a *vertically opposite* (also called *vertical*) angle. That\u2019s the correct geometric relationship to use when two lines intersect.  \n- **What\u2019s missing:** The vertical\u2011angle theorem tells us that the two opposite angles are **congruent** (they have the same measure). To earn a correct answer you need to (1) state that the angle you\u2019re looking for is the vertical angle of the given one, and (2) give its measure (which is exactly the same as the given angle).\n\n**How to improve**\n\n1. **Recall the theorem:**\u202fIf two lines intersect, each pair of opposite (vertical) angles are equal.  \n2. **Apply it directly:**\u202fIf the problem tells you that one of the angles is, say, 42\u00b0, then the vertical angle is also 42\u00b0.  \n3. **Write a complete sentence:**\u202f\u201cBecause vertical angles are equal, the measure of the angle opposite the 42\u00b0 angle is also 42\u00b0.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Next practice question\n\nTwo straight lines intersect at point\u202f\\(P\\).
