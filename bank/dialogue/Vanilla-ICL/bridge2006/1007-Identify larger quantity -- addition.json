So the answer you gave is **incorrect**.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s easy to miss: when two numbers are added, it helps to write the sums down step\u2011by\u2011step or use a mental \u201cmake\u2011tens\u201d strategy (e.g., 12\u202f+\u202f7 \u2192 12\u202f+\u202f8\u202f=\u202f20, then subtract 1 \u2192 19).
