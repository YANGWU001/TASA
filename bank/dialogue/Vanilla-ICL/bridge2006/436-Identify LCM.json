Recognizing where you\u2019re stuck is the first step toward learning.\n\n**Why 8 and 12 need a LCM**\n\n- A *multiple* of a number is any number you get by multiplying that number by an integer (e.g., multiples of 8 are 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u202f40,\u202f\u2026).\n- The **least common multiple** of two numbers is the smallest positive number that appears in *both* of their multiple lists.\n\n**Quick way to find the LCM**\n\n1. **Prime\u2011factor each number**  \n   - 8 = 2\u00b3  \n   - 12 = 2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u00b9  \n\n2. **Take each prime factor the greatest number of times it appears**  \n   - For 2, the highest exponent is 3 (from 8).  \n   - For 3, the highest exponent is 1 (from 12).  \n\n3. **Multiply those together**  \n   LCM = 2\u00b3\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u00b9 = 8\u202f\u00b7\u202f3 = **24**.\n\nSo the LCM of 8 and 12 is **24**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nFind the least common multiple of **9** and **15**.\n\n**Hints to help you:**\n\n1.
