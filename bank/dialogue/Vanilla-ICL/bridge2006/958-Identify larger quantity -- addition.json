Even if one addend is larger (Ethan\u2019s 9 is bigger than Mia\u2019s 8), the *sum* can still be smaller if the other addend is much smaller (4 vs. 6).

However, the reasoning you used (\u201cthe larger starting number wins\u201d) is **not a reliable rule** for this skill. That\u2019s why you were only getting 40\u202f% correct on the recent attempts.\n\n**How to improve**\n\n1. **Add the two numbers for each person.** Write the addition sentence (e.g.,\u202f`7\u202f+\u202f4\u202f=\u202f11`).  \n2. **Compare the two sums** directly.
