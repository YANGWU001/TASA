Choose a number that is a multiple of 7 (e.g., 14, 21, 28, \u2026).  \n2. Recognize that the LCM will be that same multiple.\n\nNow let\u2019s try another one so you can practice the same idea.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question\n\nTwo numbers are **12** and **______**.  \nOne of the numbers is a multiple of the other, and the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers is **______**.\n\n**Your task:** Fill in the two blanks.\n\n*Hint:*  \n- Think of a number that is a multiple of 12.  \n- When one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is the larger number.\n\nWrite your answer in the form: \u201cThe missing number is ___ and the LCM is ___.\u201d  \n\nGive it a try, and I\u2019ll let you know how you did!",
