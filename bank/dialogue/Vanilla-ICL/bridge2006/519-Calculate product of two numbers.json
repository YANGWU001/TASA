The question was:\n\n*\u201cEach cupcake needs 7 chocolate chips. If the baker makes 8 cupcakes, how many chocolate chips does the baker need?\u201d*\n\nTo solve it we multiply the number of chips per cupcake (7) by the number of cupcakes (8):\n\n\\[\n7 \\times 8 = 56\n\\]\n\nSo the correct answer is **56 chocolate chips**.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re unsure, try to picture the situation or write down the numbers and the multiplication sign (\u202f\u00d7\u202f).
