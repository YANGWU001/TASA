Squares that only meet at a corner are **not** considered connected.\n\nIn the grid you were given:\n\n```\n\u25a1 \u25a0 \u25a1 \u25a1\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a1 \u25a1\n\u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a0 \u25a0\n```\n\nthe shaded squares form **two** separate groups:\n\n1.

Look at each shaded square (\u25a0).  \n2. Starting with any shaded square, follow all the squares that share a side with it. All squares you can reach this way belong to the same contiguous part.  \n3. When you cannot reach any more shaded squares from the current group, start a new count with any remaining shaded square.  \n4. Continue until every shaded square belongs to a counted group.\n\nWrite down the number of separate groups you find. When you\u2019re ready, let me know your answer and I\u2019ll give you feedback!",
