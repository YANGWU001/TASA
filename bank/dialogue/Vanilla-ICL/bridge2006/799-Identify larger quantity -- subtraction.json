The goal of the question is to look at the two quantities, compare them, and write the larger one.\n\n- Sam has **27** red marbles.  \n- Lily has **19** blue marbles.\n\nBecause **27\u202f>\u202f19**, the larger quantity is **27**.  \n\nWhen you compare two numbers, start by looking at the tens place (the left\u2011most digit). Both numbers have 2 tens, but the ones place is 7 for Sam and 9 for Lily. Since 7 is greater than 9? Actually 7 > 9 is false; we should compare the whole numbers: 27 vs 19 \u2013 the tens digit is the same (2), but the ones digit for 27 is 7, which is larger than the ones digit 9? Wait, 7 is less than 9, but because the tens digit is the same, the larger number is the one with the larger ones digit. However 7\u202f<\u202f9, so 27 is actually **not** larger? Let's correct: 27 vs 19 \u2013 the tens digits are 2 and 1. Since 2\u202f>\u202f1, 27 is larger regardless of the ones digit. So the larger quantity is **27**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem \u2013 Which Number Is Bigger?**\n\n> *A classroom has **42** chairs, and the library has **58** chairs.
