Here\u2019s why:\n\n| Number | Prime factorization |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| 12     | 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3             |\n| 36     | 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3          |\n\nThe common prime factors are **2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3**, which multiply to **12**. However, the *greatest* factor that divides **both** numbers **without leaving any leftovers** is the largest *common* divisor that also fits evenly into the smaller number (12). Since 12 itself does not divide 36 an integer number of times without exceeding 12 (12\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f36, which is fine, but we need the *largest* factor that is **common** to both), the largest factor that appears in **both** factorizations but does not exceed the smaller number is **6** (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3).  \n\nAnother quick way to see it: 12 goes into 36 exactly **3** times, so 12 is a multiple of 36\u2019s divisor set. The common divisors are 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f",

That\u2019s the right answer, even if you still feel a little unsure. Remember:\n\n* The GCF is the **largest whole number** that can divide **both** numbers without leaving a remainder.  \n* When one number is a multiple of the other (like 36\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f12), the GCF will always be the **smaller number**\u2014because the smaller number divides itself and also divides the larger number.\n\nSo for 12 and 36, the smaller number is 12, but 12 does **not** divide 36 evenly (36\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f3, which is fine), actually it does\u2014so the GCF could be 12. Wait, let\u2019s check: 12\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f1, 36\u202f\u00f7\u202f12\u202f=\u202f3 \u2192 no remainder, so the GCF is **12**, not 6. Oops! I made a mistake in the earlier feedback. Let\u2019s clarify:\n\n* **12** divides both 12 and 36, so the **greatest** common factor is **12**, not 6.  \n* The number 6 is also a common factor, but it isn\u2019t the *greatest* one.\n\nDon\u2019t worry\u2014getting the idea of \u201cgreatest\u201d takes practice, and you\u2019re on the right track by thinking about divisibility",

Both numbers contain two 2\u2019s and one 3, so:\n\n  GCF = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = **12**?  Wait \u2013 that would be 12, not 6.  \n  Actually, we only need the *smallest* set of common factors that appear in **both** numbers. The *greatest* factor they both share is **6** (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3).  \n\n  Another quick way: since 12 goes into 36 exactly 3 times (36\u202f=\u202f12\u202f\u00d7\u202f3), any factor of 12 is automatically a factor of 36. The largest factor of 12 is 12 itself, but 12 isn\u2019t a factor of 36? It is! 36 \u00f7 12 = 3, so actually the GCF of 12 and 36 is **12**.  \n\n**Hold on!**  \nYou\u2019ve caught a subtle point: when one number is a multiple of the other, the GCF is the *smaller* number. Since 36 = 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, the GCF of 12 and 36 is **12**, not 6.\n\nSo in this particular pair, the",
