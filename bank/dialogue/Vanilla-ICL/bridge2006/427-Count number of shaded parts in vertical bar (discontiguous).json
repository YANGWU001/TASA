Because you didn\u2019t give a number, we can\u2019t say the answer is correct.  \n\nTo move forward, try to:\n\n1. **Look at the whole bar** and notice how many equal sections it has in total.  \n2. **Identify which sections are shaded** (they may be alternating, grouped together, or scattered).  \n3. **Count only the shaded ones**\u2014ignore the unshaded sections.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to get the exact number on the first try; just describe what you see (e.g., \u201cthe bar has 8 sections, and every other one is shaded\u201d).

Start at the top of the bar and move downward.  \n2. Every time you see a shaded block that is **separated by at least one unshaded (blank) row** from the previous shaded block, you start a new count.  \n3.

Whenever you see a shaded square that is **not** directly below another shaded square, start a new count \u2013 you have found the beginning of a new continuous block.  \n3.
