Even if you\u2019re unsure, you can still look at the visual cues:\n\n* The bar is a single straight line that runs horizontally.  \n* Small vertical tick\u2011marks (or short lines) are drawn on the bar.

That number is the answer.\n\nIn the last problem there were ___ (for example, 4) tick\u2011marks, which created ___ (for example, 5) equal segments.
