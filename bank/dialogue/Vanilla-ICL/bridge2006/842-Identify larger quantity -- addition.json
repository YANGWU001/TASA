That\u2019s okay\u2014let\u2019s work through the idea together.\n\nTo compare the totals you need to **add** the red and blue marbles in each bag:\n\n1. **Lila\u2019s bag:**\u202f7\u202f(red)\u202f+\u202f5\u202f(blue) = **12** marbles.  \n2. **Sam\u2019s bag:**\u202f4\u202f(red)\u202f+\u202f9\u202f(blue) = **13** marbles.\n\nNow compare the two sums: 12\u202fvs\u202f13. Since 13\u202f>\u202f12, **Sam\u2019s bag contains the larger total number of marbles**.\n\nSo the correct answer would have been \u201cSam\u2019s bag.\u201d  \n\nYou were close\u2014once you add the numbers, the comparison becomes easy.
