The only slip is the result:  \n  \\[\n  13 - 7 = 6\n  \\]  \n  (because 13\u202f\u2013\u202f7 removes 7 from 13, leaving 6). So the difference is **6 marbles**, not 5.\n\nKeep double\u2011checking the final step; a quick mental \u201ccount up\u201d can help: start at 7 and count up to 13 (7\u202f\u2192\u202f8\u202f\u2192\u202f9\u202f\u2192\u202f10\u202f\u2192\u202f11\u202f\u2192\u202f12\u202f\u2192\u202f13) \u2013 you count 6 steps, so the answer is 6.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nYou see two boxes of crayons:\n\n- **Box\u202fX** contains **9** crayons.  \n- **Box\u202fY** contains **14** crayons.\n\n**Your tasks**\n\n1. **Identify the larger quantity.** Which box has more crayons?  \n2. **Write the correct subtraction sentence** (larger\u202f\u2013\u202fsmaller).  \n3. **Calculate the difference** \u2013 how many more crayons does the larger box have?\n\n*Take a moment, then give your answer.
