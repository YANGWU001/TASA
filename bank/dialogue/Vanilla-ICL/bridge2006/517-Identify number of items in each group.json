Practicing this skill helps you become faster and more accurate when solving word problems or working with data.\n\n- **How to improve:**  \n  1. **Look at one basket at a time.**  \n  2. **Point to each item** (or trace your finger) and say the number out loud as you count.  \n  3. **Write the total** for that basket before moving to the next one.  \n  4. **Check your work** by counting each basket a second time.\n\nGive it another try with a new picture below.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Instructions:** Look at each basket and write the number of items it contains.
