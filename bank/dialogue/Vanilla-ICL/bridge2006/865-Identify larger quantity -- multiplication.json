Each collection is described by a *number of groups* and a *size of each group*.  \nTo find out how many items are in a collection, you multiply:\n\n\\[\n\\text{total items} = (\\text{number of groups}) \\times (\\text{size of each group})\n\\]\n\nOnce you have the two totals, you can see which one is bigger. If you skip the multiplication step, you don\u2019t have enough information to answer the question.\n\n**How to solve this type of problem**\n\n1. Identify the two numbers that belong together for each collection (e.g., \u201c4 baskets with 6 apples each\u201d).  \n2. Multiply those two numbers to get the total for that collection.  \n3.
