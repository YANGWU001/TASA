The question asks for the time when both friends will finish a round together.  \n\n- The two numbers are **7** and **21**.  \n- Since **21\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f7**, the larger number (21) is already a multiple of the smaller one (7).  \n- Therefore the **least common multiple (LCM)** of 7 and 21 is **21**.  \n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n> **Both friends will finish a round together after 21 minutes.**\n\nBecause the larger number is a direct multiple of the smaller, the LCM is simply the larger number.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nSam can complete a puzzle in **8** minutes.  \nRiley can complete the same puzzle in **12** minutes.\n\n1. What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 12?  \n2. Is one of the numbers a multiple of the other? Explain how you know.\n\n**Hints to help you**\n\n- List a few multiples of each number (e.g., 8,\u202f16,\u202f24,\u202f32,\u2026 and 12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u2026).  \n- Look for the smallest number that appears in **both** lists\u2014that\u2019s the LCM.  \n- After you find the LCM, check whether the larger original number divides evenly into the smaller one (or vice\u2011versa). If it does, then one number is a multiple of the other.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you find!",

That moment occurs after a number of minutes that is a multiple of **both** 7 and 21. The *smallest* such number is the LCM.\n\n**How to find the LCM when one number is a multiple of the other**\n\nWhen one of the numbers divides the other evenly (i.e., the larger number is a multiple of the smaller), the LCM is simply the larger number.\n\n- 21 \u00f7 7 = 3\u2003\u2192\u200321 is exactly 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f7.  \n- Therefore, every 21\u202fminutes, both schedules line up.\n\nSo the correct answer would have been **21 minutes**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nSam can water his garden in **8** minutes.  \nMia can water the same garden in **24** minutes (because she uses a larger hose).  \n\n**Question:** After how many minutes will Sam and Mia finish watering the garden at the same time for the first time?\n\n---\n\n### How to Solve It (Step\u2011by\u2011Step Guide)\n\n1. **Identify the two numbers.**  \n   - Sam\u2019s time = 8  \n   - Mia\u2019s time = 24  \n\n2. **Check if one number is a multiple of the other.**  \n   - Divide the larger by the smaller: 24 \u00f7 8 = 3 (no remainder).  \n   - Because 24 is a multiple of 8, the LCM is the larger number, **24**.\n\n3. **Write the answer in a complete sentence.**  \n   - *\u201cSam and",

It tells me that the idea of finding the least common multiple (LCM) when one number is a multiple of the other is still unclear.  \n\n**Why the answer is incomplete**\n\nThe problem asked for the **least common multiple** of two numbers. The LCM is the smallest positive number that both original numbers divide into without a remainder. When one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is simply the larger number.  \n\nFor example, if the two numbers are 4 and\u202f12, notice that 12\u202f=\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f4. Since 12 already contains the factor 4, the smallest number that both 4 and 12 divide into is **12** itself.  \n\nBecause you didn\u2019t finish the calculation, we can\u2019t say the answer is correct.

(Try dividing 27 \u00f7 9.)\n\n2. **If it is, what does that tell you about the LCM?**  \n   - Remember: when one number is a multiple of the other, the larger number is already the smallest common multiple.\n\n3. **Write the LCM.**  \n   - State the number and a short sentence explaining why it is the LCM.\n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re ready, let me know your answer (or tell me where you get stuck) and we\u2019ll review it together!",

However, the problem asked you to *identify the least common multiple (LCM) when one number is a multiple of the other*.  \n\n**Why \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d is not the answer**\n\n- The LCM is a specific number, not an \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n- When one integer divides the other (e.g., 4 and 12), the larger integer is automatically the smallest number that both can divide\u2014so the LCM is simply the larger number.\n\n**What you need to remember**\n\n1. **If one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM = the larger (the multiple) number.**  \n   Example: For 6 and 18, 18 \u00f7 6 = 3, so 18 is a multiple of 6. The LCM is 18.\n\n2. **Why this works:**  \n   - The smaller number divides the larger one exactly, so the larger already contains all the prime factors of the smaller.  \n   - There is no smaller positive number that both can divide, because any smaller number would have to be less than the larger number but still be divisible by it\u2014impossible.\n\nNow let\u2019s practice applying that rule.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question\n\n**Find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers below.**  \nOne of the numbers is a multiple of the other.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 27}\n\\]\n\n*Write the LCM and, in one sentence, explain why it is the LCM.*  \n\n*(If you\u2019re unsure, remember the rule: when one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is the larger number.)*",
