In math tutoring, the first step toward solving a problem is to acknowledge that you need help, and then we can break the problem down together.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the problem you were given:\n\n> *A small bakery sells cupcakes for $2 each and muffins for $3 each. In one morning, the bakery sold a total of 7 pastries and collected $16 from those sales.*\n\nThe goal is to find **how many cupcakes and how many muffins were sold**. This is a classic two\u2011variable linear\u2011equation problem. Even if the numbers feel a bit confusing at first, the process is systematic:\n\n1. **Define variables** (e.g., let\u202f*C* = number of cupcakes, *M* = number of muffins).  \n2. **Write two equations** based on the information given:  \n   - Total pastries:\u202f*C*\u202f+\u202f*M*\u202f=\u202f7  \n   - Total money:\u202f2*C*\u202f+\u202f3*M*\u202f=\u202f16  \n3. **Solve the system** using substitution or elimination.\n\nIf you try these steps on your own, you\u2019ll see that the system has a single solution: 5 cupcakes and 2 muffins. (You can verify: 5\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f7 pastries, and 5\u00b7$2\u202f+\u202f2\u00b7$3\u202f=\u202f$10\u202f+\u202f$6\u202f=\u202f$16.)\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nLet\u2019s keep practicing with a similar but slightly different scenario. Try to follow the same three\u2011step process (define variables, write equations, solve).\n\n> **Problem:**  \n> A fruit stand sells apples for **$4 each** and bananas for **$1 each**. One afternoon the stand sold a total of **9 pieces of fruit** and collected **$22** in revenue.  \n>   \n> **How many apples and how many bananas were sold?**\n\n#### Hints (you can",

The good news is that once you see how to set up the equations, the rest is just solving a simple linear system.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nA pet store sells goldfish for **$1 each** and turtles for **$4 each**.
