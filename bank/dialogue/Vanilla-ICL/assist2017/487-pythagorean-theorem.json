To do that, you need to:\n  1. Identify the two legs you know (the distance from the wall and the height the ladder reaches).\n  2. Plug them into the Pythagorean formula \\(a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\\).\n  3. Solve for \\(c\\) (the ladder length) by taking the square root of the sum.\n\n**What a complete answer would look like**\n\n> \u201cThe ladder, the distance from the wall (6\u202fft), and the height it reaches (8\u202fft) form a right\u2011triangle.
