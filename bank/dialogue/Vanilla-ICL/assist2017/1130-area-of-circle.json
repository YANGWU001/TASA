A common slip is to square the *diameter* instead of the radius (\\(12^{2}=144\\) rather than \\(6^{2}=36\\)). That would give \\(3.14 \\times 144 \\approx 452\\), which is exactly the number you obtained. Remember to always halve the diameter first to get the radius before squaring.\n\n---\n\n### Next practice question\n\nA round table has a **radius of 8\u202fcm**.

To solve an \u201carea\u2011of\u2011a\u2011circle\u201d problem you need to:\n\n1. **Identify the radius** (half the diameter).  \n2. **Plug the radius into the formula**\u202f\\(A = \\pi r^{2}\\).  \n3. **Carry out the multiplication** (using the given value for\u202f\u03c0).  \n4. **Round the final result** as the problem asks.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the steps for the pizza problem together so you can see what a complete answer looks like.\n\n| Step | What to do | Example for the pizza |\n|------|------------|-----------------------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3  | Find the radius | Diameter = 12\u202fin \u2192 radius \\(r = \\frac{12}{2}=6\\)\u202fin |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3  | Write the area formula | \\(A = \\pi r^{2}\\) |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3  | Substitute the numbers | \\(A = 3.14 \\times (6)^{2}\\) |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3  | Compute | \\(6^{2}=36\\); \\(3.14 \\times 36 = 113.04\\) |\n| 5\ufe0f\u20e3  | Round as instructed | Nearest whole number = **113**\u202fsq\u202fin |\n\nSo the correct answer is **113\u202fsquare inches**, not 452.
