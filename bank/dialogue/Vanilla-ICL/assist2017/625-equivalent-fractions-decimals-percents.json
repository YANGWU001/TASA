You ate 3 of those slices.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{\\text{slices eaten}}{\\text{total slices}} = \\frac{3}{8}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Decimal equivalent**  \n   Divide the numerator by the denominator:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{8}=0.375\n   \\]\n\n3. **Percent equivalent**  \n   Multiply the decimal by 100:  \n   \\[\n   0.375 \\times 100 = 37.5\\%\n   \\]\n\nSo the answer to the first practice question is:\n\n- Fraction: **\\( \\frac{3}{8} \\)**\n- Decimal: **0.375**\n- Percent: **37.5\u202f%**\n\n---\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\n*You have a bottle of juice that is 250\u202fmL full.
