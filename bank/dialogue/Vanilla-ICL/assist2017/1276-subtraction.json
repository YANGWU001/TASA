Since 2\u202f<\u202f7, we need to **borrow 1 ten** (which is worth 10 ones) from the tens column.\n   - After borrowing, the tens column loses 1 (so 4 becomes 3), and the ones column gains 10:  \n     `2 + 10 = 12` ones.\n\n3. **Now subtract the ones**  \n   - `12\u202f\u2212\u202f7 = 5` \u2192 the ones digit of the answer is **5**.\n\n4. **Subtract the tens column**  \n   - After borrowing, we have 3 tens minus 1 ten: `3\u202f\u2212\u202f1 = 2` \u2192 the tens digit of the answer is **2**.\n\n5. **Combine the digits**  \n   - The result is **25**.\n\nSo, **42\u202f\u2212\u202f17 = 25**.\n\n> **Why your earlier guess of 35 was off:**  \n> You correctly thought borrowing was needed, but after borrowing you should have had 12\u202f\u2212\u202f7\u202f=\u202f5 in the ones place, and the tens column should have been reduced from 4 to 3 before subtracting the 1 ten.
