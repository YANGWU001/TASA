Your answer (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.45\u202f=\u202f2.25) would only use half of the flour.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**A school cafeteria has 7.2 liters of orange juice. It wants to pour the juice equally into 9 identical cups. How many liters of orange juice should go into each cup?**  \n*(Give your answer as a decimal rounded to two decimal places if needed.)*\n\n**Hint:** Write the division as \\(7.2 \\div 9\\). Remember you can move the decimal point to make the divisor a whole number, then place the decimal point in the quotient accordingly. \n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get!",
