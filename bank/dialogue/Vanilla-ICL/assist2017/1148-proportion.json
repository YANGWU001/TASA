The goal of the question was to find how many cups of flour are needed to make **60 mini cupcakes** when the recipe calls for **4 cups of flour for 24 cupcakes**.\n\nTo solve it, we set up a proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{flour (cups)}}{\\text{cupcakes}} \\;=\\; \\frac{4\\ \\text{cups}}{24\\ \\text{cupcakes}}\n\\]\n\nThen we ask, \u201cWhat number of cups (let\u2019s call it *x*) will give 60 cupcakes?\u201d\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{60} \\;=\\; \\frac{4}{24}\n\\]\n\nCross\u2011multiply and solve for *x*:\n\n\\[\nx \\times 24 = 4 \\times 60 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad 24x = 240 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = \\frac{240}{24}=10\n\\]\n\nSo **10 cups of flour** are needed for 60 mini cupcakes.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Proportion Puzzle \u2013 Fruit Smoothie**\n\nA recipe for a fruit smoothie uses **3 ripe bananas** to make **2 liters** of smoothie.\n\n**Question:**  \nIf you want to make **5 liters** of smoothie, how many bananas do you need?
