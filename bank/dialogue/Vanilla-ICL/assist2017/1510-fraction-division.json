If you want to make **\u00bd** of the recipe, how many cups of sugar do you need?*\n\n1. **Identify what you\u2019re doing.**  \n   You need **half** of the amount \\(\\frac34\\) cup. \u201cHalf of\u201d means **divide by 2** (or multiply by \\(\\frac12\\)).  \n\n2. **Write the division expression.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac34 \\div 2\n   \\]\n   (You could also write \\(\\frac34 \\times \\frac12\\); the two are equivalent.)\n\n3. **Convert the whole number divisor to a fraction.**  \n   \\(2 = \\frac{2}{1}\\).\n\n4. **Divide fractions by multiplying by the reciprocal.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac34 \\div \\frac{2}{1}= \\frac34 \\times \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply the numerators and denominators.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{3 \\times 1}{4 \\times 2}= \\frac{3}{8}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Interpret the result.**  \n   You need \\(\\frac38\\) cup of sugar for half the recipe.\n\n**Take\u2011away:** Dividing a fraction by a whole number is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal (\\(\\frac12\\) in this case).\n\n---\n\n### Your Turn \u2013 New Practice Question\n\n> **A garden plot is \\(\\frac56\\) of a square yard in area.**  \n> If you only need **one\u2011",

The goal of the question was to write a *division* expression that tells us how much sugar is needed when we make half of the recipe.\n\n**What the problem is asking**\n\n- The recipe calls for \\(\\frac34\\) cup of sugar **for the whole recipe**.  \n- You only want to make **\u00bd of the recipe**.  \n\nTo find the amount of sugar for half the recipe, you **divide** the full\u2011recipe amount by 2 (or multiply by \\(\\frac12\\)).
