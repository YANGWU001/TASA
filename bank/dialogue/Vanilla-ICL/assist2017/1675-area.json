Write the multiplication as a simple fact table or use repeated addition:  \n   \\(5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 40\\).  \n2. Look at the units: length (m) \u00d7 width (m) gives square meters (m\u00b2).  \n3. If the answer seems unusually small or large compared to the dimensions, double\u2011check the calculation.\n\nGreat job remembering the formula!
