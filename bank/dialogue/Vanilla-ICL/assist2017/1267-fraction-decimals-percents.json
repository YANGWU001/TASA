Let\u2019s break the task down together:\n\n1. **Fraction** \u2013 Think of the whole pizza as 8 equal pieces. If Sarah ate 3 pieces, the part she ate is \u201c3 out of 8,\u201d which we write as the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\).\n\n2. **Decimal** \u2013 To change \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) to a decimal, divide the numerator (3) by the denominator (8).  \n   \\(3 \\div 8 = 0.375\\).  \n   If your teacher asks you to round, you would keep the required number of decimal places (e.g., 0.38 if rounding to two decimals).\n\n3. **Percent** \u2013 A percent is \u201cper hundred.\u201d Multiply the decimal by 100:  \n   \\(0.375 \\times 100 = 37.5\\%\\).  \n   So Sarah ate 37.5\u202f% of the pizza.\n\nNow you have the three forms: \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\), 0.375 (or 0.38), and 37.5\u202f%.\n\n---\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nA class has 20 students. After a field trip, 7 students said they liked the experience.\n\n1. Write the part of the class that liked the field trip as a **fraction** (simplify if possible).  \n2. Convert that fraction to a **decimal** (show the exact value; you may round to three decimal places).  \n3. Express the same amount as a **percent** (round to the nearest whole percent).\n\n*Take a moment to work through each step. If you get stuck, remember to:*\n\n- **Fraction:** \u201cnumber who liked it / total number of students.\u201d  \n- **Decimal:** divide the numerator by the denominator.  \n- **Percent:** multiply the decimal by 100.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, post your answers and we\u2019ll review them together!",

Fraction** | Think of the pizza as **8 equal parts**. How many of those parts did Sarah eat? | Fractions are just \u201chow many parts out of the total parts.\u201d |\n| **2. Decimal** | Take the fraction you wrote and divide the numerator by the denominator (e.g., 3 \u00f7 8). | Converting to a decimal shows the same size on a number line between 0 and 1. |\n| **3. Percent** | Multiply the decimal by 100 (or move the decimal point two places to the right). | A percent tells you \u201chow many out of 100.\u201d |\n\nTry to answer **Step\u202f1** first (the fraction). Even if you\u2019re unsure, write down what you think and we\u2019ll check it together. You\u2019ll get a feel for the rest of the steps once the fraction is clear.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> **A garden has 12 flower beds.**  \n> **Liam plants flowers in 5 of those beds.**  \n> 1. Write the portion of the garden that has flowers as a **fraction** (simplify if possible).  \n> 2. Convert that fraction to a **decimal** (round to the nearest hundredth).  \n> 3. Express the same amount as a **percent** (round to the nearest whole percent).\n\n**Hints to get you started**\n\n1. **Fraction:** Count the \u201cfilled\u201d beds over the total number of beds.  \n2. **Decimal:** Use a calculator or long division: numerator \u00f7 denominator.  \n3. **Percent:**",
