Because of that, the substitution should be  \n\n\\[\n\\text{missing angle}=180^\\circ-70^\\circ.\n\\]\n\n3. Carrying out the subtraction gives  \n\n\\[\n\\text{missing angle}=110^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nSo the correct missing angle is **110\u00b0**, not an unfinished expression with 45\u00b0.\n\n**What to remember**\n\n- Always double\u2011check the number that the problem provides before plugging it into the formula.  \n- After writing the equation, finish the arithmetic and write the final answer in degrees.\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track\u2014keep the steps you used (identify the supplementary relationship, write the equation, substitute, compute).
