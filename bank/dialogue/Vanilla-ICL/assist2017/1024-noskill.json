We keep the same unit (chocolate bars) when we add the pieces together.\n\n2. **Adding the fractions:**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac14 \\text{ (one\u2011quarter of a chocolate bar)} \\;+\\; \\frac23 \\text{ (two\u2011thirds of another chocolate bar)}\n   \\]\n   To add them we need a common denominator.

To determine whether an answer is correct we need a complete numerical result (e.g., a simplified fraction or mixed number) and a brief justification of the steps you used.\n\nFor a problem that asks you to combine several fractional parts, the typical steps are:\n\n1. **Identify the fractions** you need to add (or subtract).  \n2. **Find a common denominator** (the least common multiple of the denominators).  \n3. **Rewrite each fraction** with that common denominator.  \n4. **Add the numerators** while keeping the common denominator.  \n5. **Simplify** the resulting fraction, if possible.\n\nSince you did not finish these steps, we cannot evaluate the correctness of the answer.
