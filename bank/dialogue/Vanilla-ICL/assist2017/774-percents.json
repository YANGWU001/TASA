Let\u2019s look at the first step you wrote:\n\n> **Discount**  \n> \\(0.15 \\times \\$120 = \\$15\\) (I think that\u2019s right\u2026)\n\n**What\u2019s correct?**  \nYou identified the right operation: a *15\u202f%* discount means you multiply the original price by 0.15.\n\n**What needs fixing?**  \nThe multiplication is off by a little bit.  \n\n\\[\n0.15 \\times 120 = \\frac{15}{100}\\times120 = \\frac{15 \\times 120}{100}= \\frac{1800}{100}= \\$18.\n\\]\n\nSo the discount is **\\$18**, not \\$15.\n\n**Why the mistake happened**  \nA common slip is to think \u201c15\u202f% of 120 is 15\u202f% of 100 (which is 15) plus a bit more,\u201d but the extra 20\u202f% of the 15\u202f% also adds \\$3, giving the total of \\$18.  \n\n**What\u2019s next?**  \nAfter finding the discount amount, the usual follow\u2011up steps are:\n\n1. **Subtract the discount** from the original price to get the sale price.  \n   \\[\n   \\$120 - \\$18 = \\$102.\n   \\]\n\n2. If the problem asks for additional calculations (e.g., tax, final cost after a second discount, etc.), you would continue with those using the new price.\n\nYou were on the right track\u2014just double\u2011check the multiplication, and you\u2019ll have the complete solution.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nA jacket is marked **$85**. The store is offering a **25\u202f%** discount on the jacket, and then a **sales tax of 8\u202f%** is added to the discounted price.\n\n**What is the final amount the customer will pay?**  \n\n*(Show each step: calculate the discount amount, the price after discount, the tax amount, and the final total.)*\n\nTake your time",
