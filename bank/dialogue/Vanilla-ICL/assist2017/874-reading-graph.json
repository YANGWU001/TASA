The **second\u2011fewest** belong to **Dates** (10). Therefore the correct answer is **Dates** (option\u202fC), not Apples.\n\n**Why the mistake happened**\n\n- It\u2019s easy to focus on the fruit name in the question (\u201cNumber of **Apples** Sold\u201d) and overlook the actual numbers on the bars.\n- When you read a graph, always start by locating the numeric values (the heights of the bars) and then compare them.\n\nGreat effort, though\u2014recognizing that you need to compare the quantities is the right first step!
