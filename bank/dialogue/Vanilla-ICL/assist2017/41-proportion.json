Learning a new skill often starts with not knowing how to begin.  \nLet\u2019s look at how you would solve the first problem, step by step, so you can see the pattern for setting up a proportion.\n\n**How to set up the proportion for the fruit\u2011cup problem**\n\n1. Identify the two related pairs:  \n   - 4 fruit cups \u2194 $2.40  \n   - 9 fruit cups \u2194 ? (the amount you\u2019re looking for)\n\n2. Write the ratio of the known pair: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{4\\ \\text{cups}}{2.40\\ \\text{dollars}}\\).\n\n3. Set that equal to the ratio of the unknown pair: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{9\\ \\text{cups}}{x\\ \\text{dollars}}\\), where \\(x\\) is the cost of 9 cups.\n\n4. Form the proportion:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{2.40} = \\frac{9}{x}\n\\]\n\n5. Solve for \\(x\\) by cross\u2011multiplying:  \n\n\\[\n4 \\times x = 9 \\times 2.40 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad 4x = 21.60\n\\]\n\n6. Divide both sides by 4:  \n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{21.60}{4} = 5.40\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** 9 fruit cups cost **$5.40**.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen the whole process, try a new problem on your own.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> **A bookstore sells notebooks.** If",

That\u2019s completely fine\u2014recognizing that you need more help is the first step toward learning.  \n\nFor a proportion problem you want to compare two equivalent ratios. In this case the ratio \u201ccost per fruit cup\u201d is the same whether you\u2019re buying 4 cups or 9 cups. If we let **x** be the cost of 9 cups, we can write the proportion:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{cost of 4 cups}}{\\text{number of cups}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{cost of 9 cups}}{\\text{number of cups}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2.40}{4} \\;=\\; \\frac{x}{9}\n\\]\n\nFrom there you solve for **x** by cross\u2011multiplying.

Solve for the unknown cost.\n\n*Take a moment to set up the ratio before you calculate. If you get stuck, let me know which part you\u2019d like help with!*",
