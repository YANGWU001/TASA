That idea is exactly what you need for a discount problem.\n\nHowever, there are two small issues in the work you posted:\n\n1. **The problem asks for a 20\u202f% discount, not 15\u202f%** \u2013 the decimal you\u2019ll use is\u202f0.20, not\u202f0.15.  \n2. You stopped after converting the percent to a decimal.  To finish the problem you still need to:\n   - Multiply the decimal discount (0.20) by the original price ($50) to find the amount saved.  \n   - Subtract that saved amount from the original price to get the final price.\n\n**Complete solution (for reference)**  \n\n| Step | What you do | Calculation | Result |\n|------|-------------|-------------|--------|\n| 1 | Convert 20\u202f% to a decimal | 20 \u00f7\u202f100 = **0.20** | 0.20 |\n| 2 | Find the discount amount | 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f$50 = **$10** | $10 saved |\n| 3 | Find the final price | $50 \u2013 $10 = **$40** | $40 to pay |\n\nSo the correct answers are **$10 saved** and a **final price of $40**.\n\nYou were very close!
