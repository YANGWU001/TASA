That\u2019s a good start!  \n\nHowever, a complete Venn\u2011diagram solution also requires you to **place the correct numbers in each region** (the left\u2011only part, the right\u2011only part, the overlap, and the \u201coutside\u201d region). Since you didn\u2019t provide any of those numbers, the answer is **incomplete**.  \n\nTo turn the sketch into a full answer you would need to:\n\n1. **Identify the three distinct groups** in the problem (only soccer fans, only basketball fans, and fans of both).  \n2. **Use the given totals** (e.g., \u201c12 love soccer\u201d, \u201c15 love basketball\u201d, \u201c5 love both\u201d) to calculate how many belong to each region.  \n3. **Fill in the numbers** in the diagram and, if asked, state how many students enjoy neither sport.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, try writing the numbers next to each part of the circles instead of just visualizing them in your head.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**\u201cClub Membership at Riverdale Middle School\u201d**\n\nRiverdale Middle School has **40 students** in a particular grade.
