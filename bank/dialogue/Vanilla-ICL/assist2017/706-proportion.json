That\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the algebra or the idea of setting up a proportion can feel a little confusing. \n\n**Why it matters:**  \nWhen we work with proportions, the first step is to translate the word problem into an equation that relates the two quantities. Even if you\u2019re unsure about the next steps, writing down what you do know (for example, \u201clet\u202fL be the price of a large item\u201d or \u201cthe ratio of large to medium items is \u2026\u201d) gives us a solid starting point to build on.\n\n**What to try next:**  \n1.

Replace the unknowns with variables and set up the proportion.  \n4. Solve for the unknown variable.\n\nEven a partial attempt (e.g., \u201cLet\u202fL = price of a large item; 3\u202fL = 5\u202fM\u201d) shows progress and lets us see where you might be stuck.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nA recipe for a fruit punch calls for a mixture of orange juice and pineapple juice in the ratio **3\u202f:\u202f2**.

Let \\(O\\) be the number of cups of orange juice and \\(P\\) be the number of cups of pineapple juice.  \n2. Write the ratio condition as a proportion: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{O}{P} = \\frac{3}{2}\\).  \n3. Write the total\u2011volume condition: \\(O + P = 25\\).  \n4.
