That\u2019s okay\u2014recognizing when you need help is the first step toward learning!  \n\nThe expression we asked you to evaluate involves several different operations (parentheses, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction). To solve it correctly you need to follow the **order of operations** (often remembered by the acronym **PEMDAS/BODMAS**):\n\n1. **Parentheses / Brackets** \u2013 do anything inside them first.  \n2. **Exponents / Orders** \u2013 evaluate powers or roots.  \n3. **Multiplication and Division** \u2013 work from left to right.  \n4. **Addition and Subtraction** \u2013 work from left to right.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, try to apply those steps one by one. If you get stuck, feel free to ask for a hint before you compute the final answer.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\nYou\u2019re still planning that snack party.
