Multiply the numerators: \\(35 \\times 48 = 1{,}680\\).\n2. Keep the denominator \\(100\\): \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1{,}680}{100}\\).\n3. Simplify the fraction (or convert to a decimal): \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1{,}680}{100}=16.8\\).\n\nSince we can\u2019t give a fraction of a cupcake in a real\u2011world setting, we would round to the nearest whole cupcake (usually down, because you can\u2019t give \u201cpartial\u201d cupcakes unless they\u2019re cut). So **16 cupcakes** would be given away, and the remaining 32 cupcakes stay for later.\n\n**What you did well**\n- Identified the percent as a fraction \\(\\frac{35}{100}\\).\n- Set up the expression \u201cpercent\u202f\u00d7\u202fwhole\u201d.\n\n**What to improve**\n- Finish the multiplication and simplify the result.\n- Remember to interpret the final number in the context (whole items vs. fractions).\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nA classroom has **72 pencils**.
