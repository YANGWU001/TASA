The numbers 7,\u202f5 and\u202f40 do not appear in the original sentence, so the equation you formed does not represent the problem.\n\n### How to Set Up the Correct Equation\n\n1. **Identify the operation order** (the \u201corder of operations\u201d or PEMDAS).  \n   - First: multiply the unknown by 4 \u2192 \\(4 \\times x\\).  \n   - Then: subtract 7 \u2192 \\((4x) - 7\\).  \n   - The whole expression equals 9 \u2192 \\((4x) - 7 = 9\\).\n\n2. **Write the equation exactly as the sentence says**:  \n\n\\[\n4x - 7 = 9\n\\]\n\nThat is the only equation you need to solve.\n\n### Solving the Correct Equation (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\n1. **Add 7 to both sides** to undo the \u201c\u2011\u202f7\u201d.  \n\n\\[\n4x - 7 + 7 = 9 + 7 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 4x = 16\n\\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 4** to isolate \\(x\\).  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x}{4} = \\frac{16}{4} \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x = 4\n\\]\n\nSo the hidden number is **4**.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\nLet",
