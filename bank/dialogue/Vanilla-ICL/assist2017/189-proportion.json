Since no answer was given, we can\u2019t say it\u2019s correct or incorrect, but we can work together to see how the problem can be solved.\n\n**How the original problem works**\n\n> *A recipe for chocolate\u2011chip cookies calls for **2 cups of flour** for every **5 cookies** you want to bake.  \n> If you want to make **20 cookies**, how many cups of flour do you need?*\n\nThe key idea is a **proportion**: the ratio of flour to cookies stays the same no matter how many cookies you bake.\n\n1. Write the given ratio as a fraction:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\text{flour (cups)}}{\\text{cookies}} = \\frac{2}{5}\n   \\]\n\n2. Let \\(x\\) be the unknown number of cups needed for 20 cookies.

Because no numerical answer was given, we can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s right or wrong, but we can use this moment to practice the thinking steps that a proportion problem requires:\n\n1. **Identify the two quantities that are linked** (here: cups of flour \u2194 number of cookies).  \n2. **Write the given ratio** in the form \u201cA\u202funits of X for B\u202funits of Y.\u201d  \n3. **Set up a proportion** that relates the known ratio to the unknown amount you need.  \n4. **Solve for the unknown** by cross\u2011multiplying or using a unit\u2011rate.\n\nWhen you see a similar problem, try to walk through these four steps even if you\u2019re not sure of the arithmetic yet.
