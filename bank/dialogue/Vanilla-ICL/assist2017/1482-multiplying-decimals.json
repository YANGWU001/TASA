The good news is that this type of question only requires one simple multiplication of a decimal by a percent (which we also write as a decimal).\n\n**What the problem is asking**\n\n- The sprinkler uses **0.75\u202fL** per minute at full speed.  \n- You are asked for the amount used when the speed is **60\u202f%** of full speed.\n\n**How to solve it (step\u2011by\u2011step)**  \n\n1. **Convert the percent to a decimal:** 60\u202f%\u202f=\u202f0.60.  \n2. **Multiply the full\u2011speed usage by that decimal:**  \n\n\\[\n0.75 \\times 0.60 = ?\n\\]\n\n3. **Do the multiplication:**  \n   - Ignore the decimal points first: \\(75 \\times 60 = 4500\\).  \n   - Count the total number of decimal places in the factors (two in 0.75 and two in 0.60 \u2192 4 places).  \n   - Place the decimal point four places from the right: \\(0.4500 = 0.45\\).\n\n**Answer:** The sprinkler uses **0.45\u202fL per minute** at 60\u202f% speed.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> **A recipe calls for 2.4\u202fcups of milk.** If you want to make only **\u2154** of the recipe, how many cups of milk should you use?  \n> (Round your answer to the nearest hundredth if necessary.)\n\n**Steps you\u2019ll need:**\n1.

What\u2019s most important is that you *try* to apply what you\u2019ve learned, even if the answer isn\u2019t right the first time.  \n\nWhen a problem asks you to find a quantity that is a certain **percent** of another quantity, the usual steps are:\n\n1. **Convert the percent to a decimal.**  \n  \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f60\u202f%  \u2192 \u202f0.60  \n\n2. **Multiply** the decimal by the original amount.  \n  \u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f0.60\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.75\u202fL/min  \n\nIf you had multiplied those two numbers, you would have gotten the amount of water used at 60\u202f% speed.
