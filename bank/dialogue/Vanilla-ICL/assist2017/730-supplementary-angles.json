From there we translate the relationship between the angles (e.g., \u201cone is twice the other\u201d) into an algebraic equation and solve for the unknown measures.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the reasoning quickly so you can see the pattern for the next problem:\n\n1. **Define a variable** for the unknown angle.  \n   Example: let the smaller angle be \\(x\\) degrees.  \n2. **Express the other angle** using the given relationship.  \n   If it\u2019s \u201ctwice as large,\u201d the larger angle is \\(2x\\).  \n3. **Write the supplementary condition**: \\(x + 2x = 180\\).  \n4. **Solve** for \\(x\\): \\(3x = 180 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = 60\\).  \n5. **Find the second angle**: \\(2x = 120\\).  \n\nSo the two angles would be **60\u00b0** and **120\u00b0**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> **Two angles are supplementary.**  \n> One of the angles is **30\u00b0 more** than the other.  \n> **Find the measure of each angle.**  \n> (Show all steps: define a variable, set up the equation, solve, and state both angle measures.)\n\n**Tip:** Start by letting the smaller angle be \\(x\\) degrees.
