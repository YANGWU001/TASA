No worries\u2014let\u2019s review the concept and solve the problem together.\n\n**What is perimeter?**  \nThe perimeter of a shape is the total distance around its outside edge. For a rectangle you add up the lengths of all four sides. Because opposite sides are equal, a quick formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n\\]\n\n**Applying it to the garden**\n\n- Length = 4\u202fm  \n- Width  = 3\u202fm  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (4 \\text{ m} + 3 \\text{ m}) = 2 \\times 7 \\text{ m} = 14 \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\nSo you would need **14\u202fmeters of fence** to go all the way around the garden.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**\u201cBuild a Play Area\u201d**\n\nYou are planning a rectangular play area that is **6 meters long** and **5 meters wide**.
