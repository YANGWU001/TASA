The goal of the practice question is to help you see how a single situation (eating part of a pizza) can be expressed in three different but equivalent ways: as a fraction, a decimal, and a percent.  \n\nBelow is the full solution so you can see the steps. Keep reading; the process will become clearer with a little practice.\n\n---\n\n### Solution to the Pizza Problem  \n\n**Situation:** A pizza is cut into 8 equal slices. You eat 3 slices.\n\n1. **Fraction** \u2013 The part you ate is \u201c3 out of 8,\u201d so the fraction is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{8}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Decimal** \u2013 Convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{8}=0.375\n   \\]\n\n   Rounded to the nearest hundredth (two decimal places) \u2192 **0.38**.\n\n3. **Percent** \u2013 Multiply the decimal by 100 (or convert the fraction directly):\n\n   \\[\n   0.375 \\times 100 = 37.5\\%\n   \\]\n\n   Rounded to the nearest whole percent \u2192 **38\u202f%**.\n\nSo the three equivalent expressions are:\n\n* Fraction: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8}\\)  \n* Decimal (nearest hundredth): **0.38**  \n* Percent (nearest whole percent): **38\u202f%**\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen the steps, try a similar problem on your own. Remember to work through each part in the order **fraction \u2192 decimal \u2192 percent**.\n\n> **Question:**  \n> A bottle of juice contains 12\u202foz of liquid. You drink 5\u202foz. Express the amount you drank as:\n> \n> 1. A fraction of the bottle (simplify if possible)  \n> 2. A decimal (rounded to the nearest hundredth)  \n> 3. A percent",
