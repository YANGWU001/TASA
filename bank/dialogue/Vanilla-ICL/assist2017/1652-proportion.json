That\u2019s okay\u2014sometimes the numbers can feel a bit confusing at first. Let\u2019s pause and look at the problem together so you can see a clear path to the answer.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Review of the Original Problem  \n\n> **Recipe:** 4\u202fcups water\u202f+\u202f2\u202fcups orange juice \u2192 enough punch for **6 people**.  \n> **Question (implied):** If you want to make punch for a different number of people, how many cups of orange juice do you need?\n\nThe key idea is a **ratio** (or proportion). The recipe tells us the ratio of orange\u2011juice to people:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\text{orange\u2011juice (cups)}}{\\text{people}} = \\frac{2\\text{ cups}}{6\\text{ people}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\text{ cup per person}.\n\\]\n\nSo for any number of people, multiply the number of people by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) cup to get the orange\u2011juice amount.\n\nIf you\u2019re still unsure, try these steps:\n\n1. **Write the known ratio.**  \n   \\(2 \\text{ cups orange juice} : 6 \\text{ people}\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the ratio** (divide both numbers by 2).  \n   \\(1 \\text{ cup orange juice} : 3 \\text{ people}\\).\n\n3. **Set up the proportion** for the new number of people (let\u2019s call it \\(p",

A ratio tells us how many cups correspond to a certain number of people, and we use that ratio to find the amount for a *different* number of people.\n\n2. **How to use a ratio**  \n   If the original recipe is \u201c4\u202fcups orange juice for 6\u202fpeople,\u201d the ratio can be written as  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{4\\text{ cups}}{6\\text{ people}} \\;=\\; \\frac{x\\text{ cups}}{8\\text{ people}}\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(x\\) is the unknown amount of orange juice for 8 people.  \n   Solving for \\(x\\) (by cross\u2011multiplying) gives  \n\n   \\[\n   x = 4 \\times \\frac{8}{6}= \\frac{32}{6}=5\\frac{1}{3}\\text{ cups}.\n   \\]\n\n   So the correct answer would be **5\u202f\u2153 cups of orange juice**, not \u201cpeople \u00f7\u202f2.\u201d\n\n3. **Why \u201cpeople \u00f7\u202f2\u201d doesn\u2019t work**  \n   Dividing the number of people by 2 would give 4\u202fpeople for 8\u202fpeople, which has nothing to do with the amount of juice. The proportion must keep the same *relationship* between cups and people that the original recipe establishes.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> **A lemonade stand uses a recipe that calls for 3\u202fcups of water for every 2\u202fcups of lemon juice.**  \n> If the stand wants to make enough lemonade for **12\u202fcups of water**, how many cups of lemon juice are needed?\n\n#### How to approach it\n\n1. **Write the given ratio** as a fraction:",

That\u2019s okay\u2014proportion problems can feel tricky at first. The key is to set up a **ratio** that relates the known quantities to the unknown one, then solve for the unknown.
