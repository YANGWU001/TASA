That\u2019s perfectly okay\u2014recognizing a gap is the first step toward filling it!  \n\nWhen a problem asks you to *evaluate* a function, it is simply asking you to **plug the given input value into the formula** and simplify. Think of the function as a \u201cmachine\u201d: you give it a number (the input), the machine does the operations shown in the formula, and it spits out the result (the output).\n\nIn the previous question the function was something like  \n\n\\[\nP(n)=0.50n+2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the number of seeds in a packet and \\(P(n)\\) is the price in dollars. To evaluate \\(P(10)\\) you would:\n\n1. Replace every occurrence of the variable \\(n\\) with 10.  \n2. Carry out the arithmetic: \\(0.50 \\times 10 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7\\).  \n3. Write the answer: the price is **\\$7**.\n\nYou didn\u2019t attempt those steps, so there was no answer to check for correctness. Let\u2019s try another problem together, and this time I\u2019ll give you a small hint before you answer.\n\n---\n\n## Practice Question \u2013 Evaluating a Function\n\nA bakery sells cupcakes. The cost \\(C(k)\\) (in dollars) of buying \\(k\\) cupcakes is given by the function  \n\n\\[\nC(k)=1.75k+3\n\\]\n\nwhere the **\\$3** is a fixed \u201cpackaging fee\u201d that is added to every order.\n\n**Task:**  \nFind the total cost for buying **6 cupcakes**. In other words, evaluate \\(C(6)\\).\n\n### Hint\n- Write down the function again: \\(C(k)=1.75k+3\\).  \n- Replace",
