Let\u2019s break the problem down together so you can see how to write the multiplication sentence and find the answer.\n\n**Problem Recap**\n\n> *Imagine you have 4 baskets, and each basket holds 6 apples. How many apples do you have in total?*  \n\n**How to translate the story into a multiplication sentence**\n\n1. **Identify the two numbers you are multiplying**  \n   - The number of baskets = **4**  \n   - The number of apples in each basket = **6**\n\n2. **Write the multiplication sentence**  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 = \\; ?\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the product**  \n   You can add the 6 apples four times (6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6\u202f+\u202f6) or use a memorized fact:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6 = 24\n   \\]\n\nSo the total number of apples is **24**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Question:**  \nYou have **3** rows of chairs. Each row contains **7** chairs. How many chairs are there in total?  \n\n**Instructions:**  \n1. Write the multiplication sentence that represents the situation.  \n2. Solve the equation to find the total number of chairs.  \n\nGive it a try, and remember you can use either repeated addition (7\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f7) or recall the multiplication fact 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f7.
