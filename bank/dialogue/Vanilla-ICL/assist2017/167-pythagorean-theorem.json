That\u2019s okay\u202f\u2014\u202fthe first step is simply recognizing that the situation can be modeled with a right\u2011angled triangle and that the theorem relates the three side lengths:\n\n\\[\na^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(c\\) is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the two legs.\n\nIn the ladder\u2011and\u2011shed problem, the ladder is the hypotenuse, the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall is one leg, and the height where the ladder touches the wall is the other leg. Once you identify which numbers correspond to \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), you can plug them into the formula and solve for the unknown side.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question \u2013 \u201cThe Fence and the Garden\u201d\n\nA rectangular garden is 12\u202fm long. A fence runs from one corner of the garden to the opposite corner, forming a diagonal across the rectangle.\n\n1. **What is the length of the fence (the diagonal)?**  \n2. **If a 5\u2011m ladder leans against the fence, touching the ground 3\u202fm away from the corner where the ladder meets the fence, what is the height on the fence where the ladder touches?**  \n\n*Hints*  \n- For part\u202f1, treat the garden as a right\u2011angled triangle with the two sides of the rectangle as the legs.  \n- For part\u202f2, first draw the right\u2011angled triangle formed by the ladder, the ground, and the fence. Identify which side is the hypotenuse (the ladder) and which sides are known.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know which numbers you assign to each part of the triangle.
