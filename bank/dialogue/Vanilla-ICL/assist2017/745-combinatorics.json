If there\u2019s a tie, the group will pick one of the tied movies at random.\n\n**Question:**  \nHow many different possible sets of choices (i.e., who picks which movie) are there for the four people?  \n\n*Hint:* Think of each person\u2019s choice as an independent selection from the 5 movies, and then consider how many ways you can assign those choices to the four people.  \n\nGive your answer as a single integer.
