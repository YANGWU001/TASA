The pizza is divided into 8 equal slices.  \n2. You ate 3 of those slices, so the fraction of the pizza you ate is  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8}.\n\\]\n\n3. Convert the fraction to a percent:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{8}=0.375 \\quad\\text{(divide 3 by 8)}.\n\\]\n\n4. Multiply by 100 to change the decimal to a percent:\n\n\\[\n0.375 \\times 100 = 37.5\\%.\n\\]\n\nSo you actually ate **37.5\u202f%** of the pizza.
