That\u2019s okay\u202f\u2014\u202fthe important thing is to start practicing the steps for solving a simple linear equation.  \n\nRecall the story problem:\n\n> Maya buys stickers that cost \\$2 each and pays a flat shipping fee of \\$5. She spends a total of \\$27. How many stickers did she buy?\n\nTo solve it, you would:\n\n1. **Translate the words into an equation.**  \n   Let \\(x\\) be the number of stickers.  \n   Cost of stickers = \\(2x\\).  \n   Total cost = stickers + shipping = \\(2x + 5\\).  \n   Set this equal to the amount Maya spent:\u2003\\(2x + 5 = 27\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the variable.**  \n   Subtract 5 from both sides:\u2003\\(2x = 22\\).  \n   Divide both sides by 2:\u2003\\(x = 11\\).\n\nSo Maya bought **11 stickers**.  \n\nIf any of those steps feel fuzzy, let\u2019s practice with a new problem that follows the same pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Story:**  \nLiam is ordering custom t\u2011shirts.

Define a variable (e.g., \\(n\\)) for the number of t\u2011shirts.  \n2. Write an equation that represents the total cost.  \n3. Solve the equation for the variable.  \n\nGive it a try, and let me know the equation you set up and the answer you obtain!
