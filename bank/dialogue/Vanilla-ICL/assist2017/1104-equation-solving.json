The important next step is to try to translate the words into a mathematical statement.  \n\nIn this problem the unknown is the original number of marbles. If we call that number **x**, the story tells us:\n\n1. **Double the number:**\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fx  \n2. **Add 5 more:**\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f5  \n3. **Result is 27:**\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f27  \n\nSo the equation you would solve is **2x\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f27**.
