      "content": "**Feedback on Your Answer**\n\nGreat job showing your work! Let\u2019s look at each step.\n\n1. **Recall of the triangle\u2011angle sum** \u2013\u202fYou correctly remembered that the three interior angles of any triangle add to **180\u00b0**. This is a fundamental property that comes from the fact that a triangle can be \u201ccompleted\u201d to a straight line (or, as you hinted, by drawing a line parallel to one side through the opposite vertex).\n\n2. **Adding the two known angles** \u2013\u202fYou added the given angles correctly:  \n   \\(45^\\circ + 65^\\circ = 110^\\circ\\).\n\n3. **Subtracting from 180\u00b0** \u2013\u202fYour subtraction was also correct:  \n   \\(180^\\circ - 110^\\circ = 70^\\circ\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion** \u2013\u202fThe third angle **is 70\u00b0**.  \n\nYour uncertainty about \u201cmaybe 80\u00b0\u201d is understandable, but the arithmetic shows that the missing angle is **70\u00b0**, not 80\u00b0. The reason the answer is not larger is that the two known angles already take up 110\u00b0 of the 180\u00b0 total, leaving exactly 70\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n### Why the Sum Is Always 180\u00b0\n\nOne way to see this is to extend one side of the triangle and draw a line through the opposite vertex that is **parallel** to the extended side. The alternate\u2011interior angles formed are congruent to the two angles at the base of the triangle. Those three angles now sit on a straight line, whose measure is 180\u00b0. Because the parallel line creates equal angles, the three interior angles of the original triangle must also add to 180\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**A triangle has two interior angles that measure 30\u00b0 and 95\u00b0. What is the measure of the third angle? Show your work step\u2011by\u2011step and briefly explain why the sum of the interior angles must be 180\u00b0.**\n\n*Tip",

It\u2019s perfectly normal to feel stuck when you\u2019re still learning a new idea.  \n\nRemember the key fact we\u2019re using:\n\n> **The interior angles of any triangle always add up to 180\u00b0.**  \n\nWhen you know two of the angles, you can find the third one by **subtracting the sum of the two known angles from 180\u00b0**.\n\nLet\u2019s practice that step together with the numbers from the previous problem:\n\n- Known angles: 45\u00b0 and 65\u00b0  \n- Their sum: 45\u00b0\u202f+\u202f65\u00b0 = **110\u00b0**  \n- Subtract from 180\u00b0: 180\u00b0\u202f\u2212\u202f110\u00b0 = **70\u00b0**\n\nSo the third angle should be **70\u00b0**, not 80\u00b0.  The reason is simply that the three angles must total 180\u00b0, and 45\u202f+\u202f65\u202f+\u202f70 = 180.  \n\nYou were on the right track by recalling the 180\u00b0 rule; you just need to finish the subtraction step.
