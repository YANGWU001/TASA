Knowing the process will let you answer similar questions on your own next time.\n\n---\n\n### How to Find the Discounted Price\n\n1. **Identify the original price and the discount rate**  \n   - Original price of one cupcake = **$8**  \n   - Discount = **15\u202f%** (which means 15 out of every 100 parts of the price are taken off)\n\n2. **Convert the percent to a decimal**  \n   \\[\n   15\\% = \\frac{15}{100}=0.15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the amount of discount**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Discount amount}= \\text{original price} \\times \\text{decimal discount}\n   = 8 \\times 0.15 = 1.20\n   \\]\n\n4. **Subtract the discount from the original price**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Discounted price}= 8 - 1.20 = 6.80\n   \\]\n\nSo the cupcake would cost **$6.80** after the 15\u202f% discount.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen the steps, try a similar problem on your own.\n\n> **A pair of sneakers costs $45.
