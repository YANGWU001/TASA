That\u2019s perfectly okay\u2014LCM can be tricky the first few times you see it.  \n\nHere\u2019s a quick reminder of the steps you\u2019ll need to use:\n\n1. **Factor each number into primes.**  \n2. **Identify every distinct prime that appears.**  \n3. **For each prime, take the highest exponent that shows up in any factorization.**  \n4. **Multiply those highest\u2011power primes together \u2013 the product is the LCM.**\n\nIn the Maya problem the numbers were the lengths of two performance cycles (e.g., 4\u202fminutes and 6\u202fminutes). The LCM tells us the earliest time both groups will start a new act together again.\n\nIf you work through the steps above, you\u2019ll see how the answer is obtained. Don\u2019t worry if the process feels a bit long at first; with practice it becomes automatic.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Story Prompt:**  \nA school cafeteria serves lunch every **5** minutes and a snack bar restocks its supplies every **8** minutes. Both start their cycles at 9:00\u202fAM.  \n\n**Question:**  \nAt what time will the cafeteria and the snack bar next reset **simultaneously**?\n\n**Hints to guide you (you don\u2019t have to look at them all at once):**  \n\n1. Write the two cycle lengths: 5 and 8.  \n2. List the prime factors of each number.  \n3. Determine the highest power of each prime that appears.  \n4. Multiply those highest powers to get the LCM (the number of minutes after 9:00\u202fAM).  \n5. Add that number of minutes to 9:00\u202fAM to find the clock time.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get\u2014or where you get stuck!",
