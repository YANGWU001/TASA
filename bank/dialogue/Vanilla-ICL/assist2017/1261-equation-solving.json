However, you realize you only have space for 3 rows of flowers, each still with **x** plants, plus 8 extra plants you want to keep in a pot. Write an equation to represent this situation and solve for the number of plants **x** in each row.*\n\n---\n\n**What to do:**\n1. Translate the description into an algebraic equation.\n2.

In a tutoring setting we try to see the reasoning you would use, even if you\u2019re unsure of the final answer. \n\nWhen a problem asks you to \u201cfind an expression for the total number of plants\u201d you can start by identifying what you know:\n\n1. **What is being counted?** \u2013 the total number of plants in the garden.  \n2. **How are the plants arranged?** \u2013 4 rows, each row contains the same number of plants, which we call **x**.  \n3. **How do you combine the pieces of information?** \u2013 If each row has **x** plants, then each row contributes **x** plants to the total. With 4 such rows, you add them together (or multiply):\u202ftotal\u202f=\u202f4\u202f\u00d7\u202f**x**.\n\nEven if you\u2019re not sure how to write the final expression, showing the steps above would let me see that you\u2019re on the right track.

Each bracelet uses **y** beads. If you make 7 bracelets, how many beads do you need in total? Write an algebraic expression that represents the total number of beads.\n\n**What to do:**\n1. Identify the variable and what it stands for.  \n2. Think about how many times that variable is used (how many bracelets).  \n3. Combine them using multiplication or addition to create the expression.\n\nGive it a try and write the expression (you don\u2019t need to solve for **y**\u2014just give the formula).

Let\u2019s look at the pieces of the problem:\n\n1. **What does the variable represent?**  \n   You correctly identified that **y** is the number of beads in one bracelet.\n\n2. **How many bracelets are being made?**  \n   The problem says **7 bracelets**.\n\n3. **How do we combine the beads from each bracelet?**  \n   When we have the same amount (\u202fy\u202f beads) repeated **7** times, we *add* y to itself 7 times:\n\n   \\[\n   y + y + y + y + y + y + y\n   \\]\n\n   Adding the same number repeatedly is exactly what **multiplication** does. So the compact way to write that sum is:\n\n   \\[\n   7 \\times y \\;\\; \\text{or} \\;\\; 7y\n   \\]\n\nYour answer **y\u202f+\u202f7** would mean \u201ctake the number of beads in one bracelet and then add 7 more beads,\u201d which is a completely different quantity. For example, if a bracelet had 10 beads, **y\u202f+\u202f7** would give 17 beads total, whereas the correct expression **7y** would give 70 beads total (10 beads \u00d7 7 bracelets).  \n\nSo the correct algebraic expression for \u201cthe total number of beads needed to make 7 bracelets, each with y beads\u201d is **7y** (or **7\u00b7y**).\n\n---\n\n###",
