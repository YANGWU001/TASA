Here\u2019s a quick step\u2011by\u2011step:\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals** and multiply the whole numbers:  \n   \\(245 \\times 6 = 1470\\).\n\n2. **Count the total decimal places** in the original numbers.  \n   - 2.45 has **2** decimal places.  \n   - 0.6 has **1** decimal place.  \n   \u2192 Total = **3** decimal places.\n\n3. **Place the decimal** in the product so that there are three digits after it:  \n   1470 \u2192 1.470 \u2192 **$1.47**.\n\nSo your estimate of $1.5 was close, but the precise answer is $1.47.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nA bakery sells a loaf of bread for **$3.28**.

Ignore the decimals** | Treat the numbers as whole numbers (e.g., 0.6 \u2192 6, 0.25 \u2192 25). | It\u2019s easier to multiply whole numbers without worrying about place value. |\n| **2. Multiply the whole numbers** | Use the standard multiplication algorithm (or a calculator). | This gives you the *raw* product before you place the decimal point back. |\n| **3. Count total decimal places** | Add the number of digits to the right of the decimal in each factor. | The final product must have exactly that many decimal places. |\n| **4. Insert the decimal** | Starting from the right\u2011most digit of the raw product, count leftward the total number of decimal places and place the decimal point. | This restores the correct magnitude of the answer. |\n\n**Example (quick reminder):**  \n\\(0.6 \\times 0.25\\)\n\n1. Ignore decimals \u2192 \\(6 \\times 25 = 150\\)  \n2. Count decimal places \u2192 1 (from 0.6) + 2 (from 0.25) = **3**  \n3. Insert decimal \u2192 150 becomes **0.150** \u2192 **0.15**  \n\nNow you have a concrete process you can apply to any problem.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem:**  \nCalculate \\(0.7 \\times 0.04\\).\n\n**What to do next (hint):**  \n\n1. Write each factor without its decimal point.  \n2. Multiply the resulting whole numbers.  \n3. Count how many decimal places were",
