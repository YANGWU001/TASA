The question was asking you to:\n\n1. **Write the part of the pizza you ate as a fraction.**  \n   Since the pizza has 8 equal slices and you ate 3 of them, the fraction is **3\u20448**.\n\n2. **Convert that fraction to a decimal (rounded to the nearest hundredth).**  \n   To change 3\u20448 into a decimal, you divide 3 by 8:  \n\n   \\[\n   3 \u00f7 8 = 0.375\n   \\]\n\n   Rounded to the nearest hundredth, that becomes **0.38**.\n\nBecause you didn\u2019t provide an answer, we can\u2019t say whether the fraction or the decimal was correct, but now you know what the steps look like. Great job for trying\u2014let\u2019s practice a bit more so it becomes automatic.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**A candy jar contains 12 pieces of candy.

If you ate 3 of those slices, the part you ate is written as \u201c3 out of 8,\u201d which is the fraction \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8}\\).\n\n2. **Decimal** \u2013 To turn \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) into a decimal, divide the numerator (3) by the denominator (8):\n   \\[\n   3 \\div 8 = 0.375\n   \\]\n   (If the instruction asked to round, you would keep the required number of decimal places.)\n\n3. **Percent** \u2013 To change the decimal to a percent, multiply by 100:\n   \\[\n   0.375 \\times 100 = 37.5\\%\n   \\]\n\nSo the complete answer would have been:\n\n* Fraction: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{8}\\)  \n* Decimal: \\(0.375\\)  \n* Percent: \\(37.5\\%\\)\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**A classroom has 20 students. 7 of them are wearing glasses.**\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Write the part of the class that is wearing glasses as a **fraction** (simplify if possible).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Convert that fraction to a **decimal** (round to three decimal places if needed).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Change the decimal to a **percent** (round to the nearest whole percent).\n\n*Take a moment to think about each step.
