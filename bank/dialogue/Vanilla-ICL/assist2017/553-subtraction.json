That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nYou stopped right at the point where you need to write down the new numbers after borrowing.

In this case, the trouble comes from the ones place (4\u202f\u2013\u202f7), which requires **borrowing** from the tens column. We\u2019ll walk through that together, and then you\u2019ll have a chance to try a new problem on your own.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Review: Borrowing (Regrouping) in Subtraction\n\n1. **Write the numbers one under the other**, aligning the tens and ones columns.  \n   ```\n     84\n   \u2013 27\n   ```\n\n2. **Start with the ones column** (rightmost).  \n   - 4 (ones) is smaller than 7 (ones), so we can\u2019t subtract directly.  \n   - Borrow **1 ten** (which is 10 ones) from the 8 tens in the top number.\n\n3. **After borrowing:**  \n   - The tens column of the top number becomes 7 (because we gave one ten away).  \n   - The ones column gains 10 ones, so 4\u202f+\u202f10\u202f=\u202f14 ones.\n\n4. **Now subtract the ones:**  \n   - 14\u202f\u2013\u202f7\u202f=\u202f7.\n\n5. **Subtract the tens:**  \n   - 7\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f=\u202f5.\n\n6. **Combine the results:**  \n   - The answer is **57**.\n\nIf you follow those steps, you\u2019ll see that **84\u202f\u2013\u202f27\u202f=\u202f57",

Write 7 in the units place of the answer.\n\n4. **Now subtract the tens column:**\n   - After borrowing, you have **7** (the original 8 became 7) minus **2** = **5**. Write 5 in the tens place.\n\n5. **Combine the results:**  \n   - Tens digit = 5, units digit = 7 \u2192 **57**.\n\nSo, **84\u202f\u2013\u202f27 = 57**.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nTry this similar subtraction problem, applying the same borrowing technique if needed:\n\n**92\u202f\u2013\u202f48 = ?**\n\nWrite the numbers in column form, work from the units column to the tens column, and tell me what you get.
