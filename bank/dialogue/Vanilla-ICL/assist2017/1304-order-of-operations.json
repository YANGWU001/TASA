To get the correct total you need to:\n\n1. **Parentheses** \u2013 do anything inside parentheses first.  \n2. **Exponents** \u2013 evaluate any powers.  \n3. **Multiplication \u00f7 Division** \u2013 work left\u2011to\u2011right.  \n4. **Addition \u00f7 Subtraction** \u2013 work left\u2011to\u2011right.\n\nIf any of those steps are missed or done out of order, the final number will be wrong.
