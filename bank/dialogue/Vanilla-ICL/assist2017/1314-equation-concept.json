The important next step is to try setting up the relationship described in the problem, even if you\u2019re not sure how to finish it. Giving it a try lets us see where the difficulty lies, so we can focus on that part together.\n\n**A Quick Hint for the Previous Problem**\n\nThe problem says:  \n\n*\u201cIf you double the number of marbles you have and then add 5 more, you end up with 23 marbles.\u201d*\n\nLet\u2019s call the original number of marbles **x**.  \n- Doubling it \u2192\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202fx (or\u202f2x)  \n- Adding 5 \u2192\u202f2x\u202f+\u202f5  \n\nThat whole expression equals 23, so the equation is  \n\n\\[\n2x + 5 = 23\n\\]\n\nIf you solve it, you\u2019ll find the original number.

If you triple the number of stickers you have and then subtract 4, you end up with **29** stickers.  \n> **What was the original number of stickers?**\n\n**Steps to try (you can write them down or speak them out loud):**  \n1. **Define a variable** for the unknown quantity (e.g., let\u202fs = original number of stickers).  \n2. **Translate the wording** into an algebraic expression: \u201ctriple the number\u201d \u2192\u202f3s, \u201csubtract 4\u201d \u2192\u202f3s\u202f\u2212\u202f4.  \n3. **Set the expression equal** to the total given (29).
