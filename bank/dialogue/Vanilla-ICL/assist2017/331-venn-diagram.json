They were asked which of the following activities they enjoy after school:\n\n* **Sports** \u2013 22 members  \n* **Music** \u2013 18 members  \n* **Art** \u2013 15 members  \n\nThe overlaps are:\n\n* 9 members enjoy **both Sports and Music**.  \n* 7 members enjoy **both Sports and Art**.  \n* 5 members enjoy **both Music and Art**.  \n* 3 members enjoy **all three** activities.\n\n### What to Do\n\n1. **Identify the three sets** (Sports, Music, Art).  \n2. **Fill in the numbers for the overlapping regions** using the data above. Remember that the \u201call three\u201d count (3) is part of each pairwise overlap, so you\u2019ll need to subtract it when you place the numbers in the diagram.  \n3. **Calculate how many members enjoy none of the three activities** and place that number outside the circles.\n\n### Hint\n\nStart with the innermost region (the",
