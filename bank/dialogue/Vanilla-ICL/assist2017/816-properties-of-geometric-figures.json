Double\u2011checking the multiplication step can help avoid this slip.\n\n**What to remember**\n\n- Write down each step clearly: first find the missing dimension, then plug it into the area formula.  \n- After you compute, a quick mental check (e.g., \u201c8 is twice 4, so the product should be bigger than 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 = 16\u201d) can catch arithmetic errors.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nA **right\u2011angled triangle** has one leg that is three times as long as the other leg.  \nIf the shorter leg measures **5\u202fcm**, what is the **area** of the triangle in square centimeters?\n\n*Hint:*  \n1.
