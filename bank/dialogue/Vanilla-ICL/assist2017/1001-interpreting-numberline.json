The line starts at\u202f0\u202fon the left and ends at\u202f10\u202fon the right. Important clues are marked at the following points:\n\n- A red X at **3**\n- A blue flag at **7**\n- A dotted line that starts at **2** and ends at **5**\n\nBelow is a sketch of the number line (you can picture it in your mind or draw it on paper):\n\n```\n0 \u2500\u2500 1 \u2500\u2500 2 \u2500\u2500 3 \u2500\u2500 4 \u2500\u2500 5 \u2500\u2500 6 \u2500\u2500 7 \u2500\u2500 8 \u2500\u2500 9 \u2500\u2500 10\n          |-----|          X                F\n          (dotted)       (red X)          (blue flag)\n```\n\n**Your task:**  \n\n1. **Identify the exact location** of the blue flag. Write the number that corresponds to the blue flag\u2019s position.  \n2. **Describe the region** covered by the dotted line. Write your answer as an interval in proper notation (for example, \\([a, b]\\) or \\((a, b)\\)).  \n\n*Remember: the number line increases from left to right, and each whole\u2011number tick represents one unit.*",

An answer is needed so we can see how you are interpreting the number\u2011line picture. Even a guess, followed by your reasoning, is useful because it shows where your thinking is at and where we can help you improve. |\n\n**What to do next**  \n1. Look again at the picture (or imagine the line).  \n2. Identify the point the problem is asking about.  \n3. Write the number you think it is, and **explain** how you decided (e.g., \u201cThe flag is directly above the tick mark labeled 7, so I think it\u2019s at 7\u201d).  \n\nYour reasoning is the most important part\u2014if you\u2019re unsure, share what you see and what confuses you.

Even if you\u2019re unsure, you can still use the clues in the picture\u2014such as the positions of other marked points, the spacing between tick marks, and any given reference numbers\u2014to make an educated guess.
