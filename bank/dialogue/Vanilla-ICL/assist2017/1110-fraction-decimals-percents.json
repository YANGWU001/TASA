That\u2019s okay\u202f\u2014\u202fthe important next step is to give it a try. Here\u2019s what the problem is asking for and how you would solve it:\n\n1. **Fraction** \u2013 The pizza is divided into 4 equal slices. You ate 3 of those slices, so the portion you ate is \u201c3 out of 4,\u201d which is written as the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Decimal** \u2013 To change \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) to a decimal, divide the numerator (3) by the denominator (4):\n   \\[\n   3 \\div 4 = 0.75\n   \\]\n\n3. **Percent** \u2013 A percent is the same as \u201cper hundred.\u201d Multiply the decimal by 100:\n   \\[\n   0.75 \\times 100 = 75\\%\n   \\]\n\nSo the correct answers would be:\n\n1. Fraction: \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)  \n2. Decimal: \\(0.75\\)  \n3. Percent: \\(75\\%\\)\n\nNow that you see the steps, try applying the same ideas to a new problem.\n\n---\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nA water bottle holds 500\u202fmL of liquid. You drink 125\u202fmL.\n\n1. Write the part you drank as a **fraction** of the whole bottle.  \n2. Convert that fraction to a **decimal**.  \n3. Express the same amount as a **percent**.\n\n*Tip:* Start by writing \u201c125\u202fmL out of 500\u202fmL\u201d as a fraction, then simplify if possible before moving to the decimal and percent forms. Give it a try, and let me know what you get!",

That\u2019s perfectly okay\u2014learning starts with giving it a try, even if you\u2019re unsure.  \n\nThe question is asking you to:\n\n1. **Write the part of the pizza you ate as a fraction** (how many slices you ate out of the total slices).  \n2. **Change that fraction into a decimal** (a number with a place value system).  \n3. **Express the same amount as a percent** (the \u201cout of 100\u201d form).\n\nTry to think of the pizza as a whole that is divided into 4 equal pieces.

Change the same amount to a **percent** (round to the nearest whole percent).\n\n*Hint:* Start by counting how many desks are occupied (the numerator) and how many desks there are in total (the denominator).
