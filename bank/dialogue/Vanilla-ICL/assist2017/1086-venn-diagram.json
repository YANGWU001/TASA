Identify overlaps** | Note any numbers that are given for students who belong to *both* sets. |\n| **3. Subtract to find \u201conly\u201d regions** | For each set, subtract the overlap to get the \u201conly\u201d portion (e.g., \u201conly video games = total video\u2011gamers \u2013 both\u201d). |\n| **4.

Let\u2019s pause, look at what a Venn diagram is, and then try a new, simpler question.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Refresher: What Is a Venn Diagram?\n\n- A Venn diagram uses **overlapping circles** to show how two (or more) sets relate to each other.  \n- **Each circle = one set** (e.g., Set\u202fA, Set\u202fB).  \n- The **overlap (intersection)** contains the elements that belong to **both** sets.  \n- The parts that do **not** overlap contain the elements that belong **only** to that one set.  \n\nThink of the circles as \u201cbuckets.\u201d Anything that falls into both buckets lands in the overlapping region.\n\n---\n\n## Practice Question\n\n**Given the following sets**\n\n- \\(A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\)  \n- \\(B = \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\)\n\n**Draw a Venn diagram** with two circles (one for \\(A\\) and one for \\(B\\)).
