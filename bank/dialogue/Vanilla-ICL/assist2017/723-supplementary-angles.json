Feedback on Your Answer  \n\n**What you did right:**  \n- You remembered the key fact about a straight line: the two adjacent angles are **supplementary**, so their measures add to \\(180^\\circ\\).  \n- You wrote the correct equation: \\(\\;73^\\circ + m\u2220B = 180^\\circ\\).\n\n**What\u2019s missing:**  \n- You stopped short of actually solving the equation. The last step is just a simple subtraction:\n\n\\[\nm\u2220B = 180^\\circ - 73^\\circ = 107^\\circ .\n\\]\n\n**Result:** Your reasoning is correct; you only need to finish the arithmetic. Once you write the final value, the answer is **complete and correct**.\n\n**Tip for next time:** After you set up the equation, double\u2011check that you\u2019ve isolated the unknown (the \u201c\\(m\u2220B\\)\u201d) on one side and performed the arithmetic.

Even if you are unsure, writing \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d does not show any mathematical reasoning or work, so it cannot be counted as a correct solution.\n\n- **Why it\u2019s important to show work:**  \n  1. **Demonstrates understanding** \u2013 By writing the equation \\(73^\\circ + m\\angle B = 180^\\circ\\) and solving, you prove that you know the definition of supplementary angles.  \n  2. **Allows partial credit** \u2013 Even if you make a small arithmetic slip, the teacher can see that you grasp the concept.  \n  3. **Builds confidence** \u2013 Seeing that the problem reduces to a simple subtraction (or addition) helps you recognize patterns for future problems.\n\n- **What you were on the right track for:**  \n  You correctly remembered that two angles that form a straight line are supplementary, so their measures add to \\(180^\\circ\\).
