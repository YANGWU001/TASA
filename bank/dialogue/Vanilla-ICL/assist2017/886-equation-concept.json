The problem we posed requires setting up and solving a system of two linear equations (one for the total number of tickets, the other for the total cost). To answer it you\u2019ll need to:\n\n1. Define variables for the unknown quantities (e.g., let\u202f*A* = number of adult tickets, *S* = number of student tickets).  \n2. Write one equation for the total tickets (A\u202f+\u202fS\u202f=\u202f9).  \n3. Write a second equation for the total cost (12A\u202f+\u202f7S\u202f=\u202ftotal dollars).  \n4.
