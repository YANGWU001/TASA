In other words, we need the *least common multiple* (LCM) of the two numbers.  \n\nLet\u2019s review the idea quickly:\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it works |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| 1.

Find the smallest number that appears in **both** lists. | In the example, the first common multiple is **12**. | That smallest common multiple is the LCM. |\n| 3. (Optional) Use prime\u2011factor method for larger numbers. | Write each number as a product of primes, take the highest power of each prime that appears, then multiply them together. | This guarantees the smallest common multiple without listing many numbers. |\n\nSo, when the question asked \u201cafter how many days will Lily and Marco ride together again?\u201d the correct answer is the LCM of 4\u202fdays and 6\u202fdays, which is **12 days**, not 10.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem:**  \nEmma goes to the library every **5** days, and Noah goes to the library every **8** days.
