It tells me that the idea of \u201cthe three interior angles of a triangle always add up to 180\u00b0\u201d isn\u2019t feeling solid yet. Let\u2019s walk through the reasoning together so you can feel confident solving it yourself.\n\n---\n\n### Why the Sum of the Angles Is 180\u00b0\n\nA triangle can be thought of as a slice of a straight line. If you place the three angles side\u2011by\u2011side, they exactly fill a straight angle, which measures **180\u00b0**. This is a fundamental property of Euclidean geometry:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Angle}_1 + \\text{Angle}_2 + \\text{Angle}_3 = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo, whenever you know two of the angles, the third one is simply:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Missing angle} = 180^\\circ - (\\text{first angle} + \\text{second angle})\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s Solve a Sample Problem Together\n\n**Problem:** A triangle has two known angles: \\(35^\\circ\\) and \\(63^\\circ\\). What is the measure of the third angle?\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step:**\n\n1. **Add the known angles**  \n   \\[\n   35^\\circ + 63^\\circ = 98^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **Subtract that sum from 180\u00b0**  \n   \\[\n   180^\\circ - 98^\\circ = 82^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Conclusion**  \n   The missing angle measures **\\(82^\\circ\\)**.\n\nNotice that the answer is **not** 70\u00b0. The mistake comes from adding the two given angles incorrectly (you added 42\u00b0\u202f+\u202f63\u00b0 instead of 35\u00b0\u202f+\u202f63\u00b0). Double\u2011checking the numbers before you subtract from 180\u00b0 helps avoid that slip.\n\n---\n\n## Your Turn: New Practice Question\n\n> **A triangle has two interior angles measuring",
