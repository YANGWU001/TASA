In combinatorics we usually break a problem like this into two steps:\n\n1. **Selection** \u2013 How many different subsets of 3 marbles can you pick from the 4?  \n   This is a \u201cchoose\u201d problem, written mathematically as \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Arrangement (if required)** \u2013 Once you have the 3 marbles, how many ways can you order them?  \n   That\u2019s a permutation of 3 objects, which is \\(3!\\).\n\nIf the problem only asked for the number of *subsets*, the answer would be \\(\\binom{4}{3}=4\\). If it also asked for the number of *ordered* triples, you would multiply: \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\times 3! = 4 \\times 6 = 24\\).\n\n**How to approach similar problems**\n\n1. **Identify whether order matters.**  \n   - *Order doesn\u2019t matter* \u2192 use combinations \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\).  \n   - *Order matters* \u2192 use permutations \\(P(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\\) or multiply a combination by \\(k!\\).\n\n2. **Write down the numbers.**  \n   Plug the values of \\(n\\) (total objects) and \\(k\\) (how",

That\u2019s perfectly okay\u2014this is a common stumbling block when you first move from counting **ordered** selections (permutations) to counting **unordered** selections (combinations).\n\nRecall the two steps:\n\n1. **Count ordered selections.**  \n   When you multiply \\(4 \\times 3 \\times 2\\) you are counting every possible *order* in which three distinct marbles could be drawn. For example, drawing marble\u202fA then\u202fB then\u202fC is considered different from drawing B\u2011A\u2011C.\n\n2. **Remove the effect of ordering.**  \n   For any *unordered* set of three marbles, there are exactly \\(3! = 6\\) different orders that produce the same set (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA).
