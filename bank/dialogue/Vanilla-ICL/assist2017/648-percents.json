Let\u2019s work through the steps together so you\u2019ll feel confident solving it on your own.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Review: How to Find a Percent Discount\n\n1. **Convert the percent to a decimal.**  \n   15\u202f% = 15 \u00f7 100 = **0.15**\n\n2. **Multiply the original price by that decimal** to get the discount amount.  \n   Discount = $60 \u00d7 0.15 = **$9**\n\n3. **Subtract the discount from the original price** to get the final price.  \n   Final price = $60 \u2013 $9 = **$51**\n\nSo the discount is **$9**, and you would pay **$51** after the discount.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\nA pair of headphones is marked at **$80**. The store runs a **22\u202f% off** sale.\n\n1. What is the dollar amount of the discount?  \n2. What is the price you will pay after the discount?\n\n*Hint:* Follow the three\u2011step process above\u2014convert the percent to a decimal, multiply to find the discount, then subtract from the original price.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get!
