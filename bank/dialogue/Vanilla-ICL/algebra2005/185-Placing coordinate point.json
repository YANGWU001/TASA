The map is drawn on a standard\u202fx\u2011y coordinate grid (the horizontal axis is the *x*-axis and the vertical axis is the *y*-axis).  \n\n**Your task:** Plot the point **(4,\u202f\u20113)** on the grid.\n\n- Start at the origin (0,\u202f0).  \n- Move **4 units to the right** along the x\u2011axis.  \n- From there, move **3 units down** (because the y\u2011value is negative).  \n\nMark the exact spot where you end up.  \n\n*(You can draw a small dot or an \u201cX\u201d at that location and label it (4,\u202f\u20113).)*\n\nOnce you\u2019ve placed the point, check that it\u2019s 4 squares over from the y\u2011axis and 3 squares below the x\u2011axis.
