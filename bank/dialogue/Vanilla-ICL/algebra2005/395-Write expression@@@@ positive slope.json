In most word\u2011problem contexts, we are dealing with a line that goes upward as we move to the right, so both the rise and the run are positive numbers.  \n\nTo **write an expression for a positive slope**, you simply place the positive rise over the positive run and keep the fraction in simplest form. For example, if a line rises 3 units while running 5 units to the right, the slope expression is  \n\n\\[\n\\displaystyle m=\\frac{3}{5}.\n\\]\n\nIf the numbers are given in variables, say the rise is \\(r\\) and the run is \\(s\\) (both known to be positive), the slope expression is  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{r}{s}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> **Problem:**  \n> A straight road climbs upward as you travel eastward.  \n> - At point\u202f\\(P\\) the road is at elevation \\(8\\) meters and the horizontal coordinate \\(x=2\\) km.  \n> - After traveling \\(4\\) km east, the elevation has increased by \\(6\\) meters.  \n>   \n> **Task:** Write an algebraic expression (in simplest fractional form) that represents the **positive slope** of this road.
