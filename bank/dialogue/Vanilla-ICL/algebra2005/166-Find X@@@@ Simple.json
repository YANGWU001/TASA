Let\u2019s walk through it together.\n\n**How to solve the example**\n\n> *A bakery sells cupcakes in boxes. Each box holds **3 cupcakes** and the total number of cupcakes in three boxes plus **5 extra cupcakes** is **20**. Let **x** be the number of \u2026*  \n\n(We\u2019ll assume the missing part is \u201cboxes\u201d \u2013 i.e., how many boxes are needed.)\n\n1. **Identify what each symbol means**  \n   - One box = 3 cupcakes \u2192\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f(number of boxes) = cupcakes from the boxes.  \n   - \u201cThree boxes plus 5 extra cupcakes\u201d means: 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f(number of boxes)\u202f+\u202f5.  \n\n2. **Set up the equation**  \n   \\[\n   3x + 5 = 20\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for\u202fx**  \n   \\[\n   3x = 20 - 5 \\\\\n   3x = 15 \\\\\n   x = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n   \\]\n\nSo **x\u202f=\u202f5** boxes. (If the problem asked for something else, the same steps apply\u2014write an equation, isolate\u202fx, and compute.)\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> **Problem:**  \n> A garden has a rectangular flower bed. The length of the bed is **4 meters longer than its width**. The **area** of the flower bed is **60 square meters**.  \n> Let **x** represent the **width** of the flower bed (in meters). Find the value of **x**.\n\n**What to do:**  \n1. Write an expression for the length in terms of\u202fx.  \n2. Use the area formula (Area\u202f=\u202flength\u202f\u00d7\u202f",
