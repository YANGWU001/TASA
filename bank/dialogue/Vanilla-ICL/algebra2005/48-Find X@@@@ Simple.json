In this problem we\u2019re asked to find the number of stickers **in each pack** (the variable\u202f*x*). Since you didn\u2019t give a numerical answer, we can\u2019t say it\u2019s correct, but we can work together to figure it out.\n\nLet\u2019s break the problem down:\n\n1. **What we know**  \n   * Total stickers after buying all the packs = 13.  \n   * The number of packs bought = **x** (the same as the number of stickers *per* pack in this wording).  \n   * Each pack holds the same number of stickers.\n\n2. **What we need to find**  \n   * The value of **x** (how many stickers are in each pack).\n\n3. **How to translate the words into an equation**  \n   * If each pack has *x* stickers and there are *x* packs, the total number of stickers is *x\u202f\u00d7\u202fx = x\u00b2*.  \n   * That total equals 13, so the equation is **x\u00b2 = 13**.\n\n4. **Solve the equation**  \n   * Take the square root of both sides: **x = \u221a13**.  \n   * \u221a13 is not a whole number (\u2248\u202f3.6055), which means the problem as written would give a non\u2011integer answer. In many \u201cfind\u202fX\u201d worksheets the numbers are chosen so that *x* is an integer, so it\u2019s possible the original statement had a small typo (for example, the total might have been 9 or 16 instead of 13).\n\n**Bottom line:** Your response \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d isn\u2019t wrong\u2014it just means you need a little more guidance. We\u2019ve now turned the story into an algebraic equation and seen how to solve it.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n",

Recognizing when you\u2019re stuck is the first step toward solving it.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick reminder of the thinking process for a \u201cfind\u202fx\u201d problem like this:\n\n1. **Identify what the variable represents** \u2013 here, **x** is the number of packs Sofia bought.  \n2. **Translate the words into an equation** \u2013 each pack has the same number of stickers (let\u2019s call that number *p*). The total number of stickers is 13, so  \n   \\[\n   \\text{(number of packs)} \\times \\text{(stickers per pack)} = 13 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad x \\times p = 13.\n   \\]\n3. **Look for additional information** \u2013 the problem should tell you either the number of stickers per pack or give another relationship that lets you solve for *x*.  \n4. **Solve for the unknown** \u2013 once you have a complete equation, isolate *x*.\n\nSince the original question is missing the crucial piece of information (how many stickers are in each pack), we can\u2019t finish the problem yet. That\u2019s why you felt stuck.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n> **Question:**  \n> A bakery makes cupcakes in batches. Each batch contains the same number of cupcakes, and the baker makes **x** batches. After baking, the total number of cupcakes is **24**. If each batch contains **6** cupcakes, how many batches did the baker make?\n\n**Steps to solve:**\n1. Write an equation that relates the number of batches (**x**) to the total cupcakes.  \n2. Substitute the known number of cupcakes per batch (6).  \n3. Solve for **x**.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get!
