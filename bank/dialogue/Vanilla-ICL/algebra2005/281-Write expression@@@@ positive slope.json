Even if you\u2019re unsure how to start, it\u2019s helpful to show any work or thoughts you have (e.g., \u201cI think I should use the point\u2011slope formula, but I don\u2019t remember the steps\u201d).

The important part is that it\u2019s >\u202f0.\n\n3. **Use the point\u2011slope form of a line.**  \n   \\[\n   y - y_1 = m\\,(x - x_1)\n   \\]\n   where \\((x_1, y_1)\\) is the given point and \\(m\\) is the slope you selected.\n\n4. **Plug in the numbers and simplify (if you wish).**  \n   For example, with point \\((3,4)\\) and slope \\(m = 2\\):\n   \\[\n   y - 4 = 2\\,(x - 3) \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad y = 2x - 2\n   \\]\n\nNow you have an equation of a line that satisfies both conditions: it passes through \\((3,4)\\) and has a positive slope.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nWrite the equation of a line that:\n\n* has a",
