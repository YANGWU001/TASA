That\u2019s completely okay\u2014recognizing where you need help is the first step toward mastering the concept.  \n\nA *negative slope* means that as the\u202f\\(x\\)\u2011coordinate (horizontal direction) increases, the\u202f\\(y\\)\u2011coordinate (vertical direction) decreases. On a graph this looks like a line that falls from left to right. The slope is calculated as  \n\n\\[\n\\text{slope}=m=\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}= \\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}.\n\\]\n\nIf the result is a negative number, the line has a negative slope.  \n\nWhen a problem asks you to \u201cwrite the expression for the negative slope,\u201d it is usually asking you to set up the fraction \\(\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\) using the given points, and then simplify it (or at least recognize that the sign will be negative).\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Problem**\n\nA skier is descending a straight slope.

Explain in one sentence what a negative slope means for the skier\u2019s movement on the hill.\n\n**Hints you might find useful**\n\n* Use the slope formula \\(m = \\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\).  \n* Substitute the coordinates carefully: decide which point will be \\((x_1,y_1)\\) and which will be \\((x_2,y_2)\\).  \n* After you write the fraction, simplify it by performing the subtraction and division.",

A slope is defined as  \n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}\n\\]\n\nIf the numerator and denominator have opposite signs, the fraction is negative, giving a negative slope.
