That\u2019s okay! Recognizing when you need help is the first step toward learning.\n\n**Why the problem is asking for a *positive* slope**\n\n- A *slope* tells us how steep a line is and whether it rises (positive) or falls (negative) as we move from left to right.\n- A **positive** slope means that as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) also increases. Graphically the line goes upward from left to right.\n- In the equation \\(y = mx + b\\), the coefficient \\(m\\) is the slope. So we need to find a value for \\(m\\) that is **greater than zero**.\n\n**How we would solve the original question (just for reference)**  \n\n1. **Pick any positive number** for the slope \\(m\\). For example, let\u2019s choose \\(m = 2\\).  \n2. Use the point \\((2,5)\\) and the slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\). Plug in the point to solve for \\(b\\):  \n   \\[\n   5 = 2(2) + b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 5 = 4 + b \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; b = 1.\n   \\]  \n3. Write the final equation: \\(\\boxed{y = 2x + 1}\\).  \n\nAny positive value for \\(m\\) (e.g., \\( \\tfrac12, 3, \\sqrt{5}\\), etc.) would work, as long as you adjust \\(b\\) so the line still passes",

Since there was no attempt, we can\u2019t evaluate the answer as correct.\n\n- **Why it matters:**  \n  Writing an algebraic expression for a line (usually in slope\u2011intercept form\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\) or point\u2011slope form) is the first step to showing you understand how the slope affects the line. A *positive* slope means that as \\(x\\) increases, \\(y\\) also increases, so the coefficient \\(m\\) in the expression must be a positive number (greater than\u202f0).\n\n- **What to try next:**  \n  1. Identify the slope you need (any positive number, e.g., \\(m = 2\\)).  \n  2. Choose a y\u2011intercept \\(b\\) (any real number, e.g., \\(b = -3\\)).  \n  3. Plug them into the slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).  \n\n  Example: With \\(m = 2\\) and \\(b = -3\\), the line\u2019s equation is **\\(y = 2x - 3\\)**. Notice the slope \\(2\\) is positive, so the line rises as you move right.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\n**Write an equation (in slope\u2011intercept form) for a line that has a positive slope of 4 and passes through the point \\((1, 5)\\).**\n\n*Steps you might follow:*\n\n1.
