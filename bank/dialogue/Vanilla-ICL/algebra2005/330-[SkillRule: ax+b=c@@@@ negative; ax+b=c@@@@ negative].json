Let\u2019s walk through what you did and why it works.\n\n1. **Original equation**\n\n\\[\n-4x + 7 = -9\n\\]\n\n2. **Isolate the term with \\(x\\)**  \n   You subtracted\u202f7 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n-4x = -9 - 7 \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad -4x = -16\n\\]\n\n   *Why?* Adding (or subtracting) the same number on both sides keeps the equality true. Removing the \u201c+\u202f7\u201d leaves only the \\(-4x\\) term on the left.\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\)**  \n   You divided both sides by \\(-4\\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-16}{-4} = 4\n\\]\n\n   *Why?* Division by the coefficient of \\(x\\) (here \\(-4\\)) isolates the variable. Remember that a negative divided by a negative gives a positive result, which is why \\(x = 4\\).\n\n**Result:** \\(x = 4\\) is correct.\n\n---\n\n### What to Watch Next time\n- **Sign conventions:** You handled the double\u2011negative perfectly. Keep double\u2011checking that a minus sign in front of a number or variable stays with it through each operation.\n- **Writing the final answer:** It\u2019s good practice to restate the solution in a sentence, e.g., \u201cThe solution to \\(-4x + 7 = -9\\) is \\(x = 4\\).\u201d\n\nOverall, you demonstrated a clear, step\u2011by\u2011step approach\u2014exactly what we want!\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Problem\n\nSolve the equation below.
