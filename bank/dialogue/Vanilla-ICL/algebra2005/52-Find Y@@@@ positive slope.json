Even a short attempt (e.g., writing \u201cslope =\u202f2/5, so \u0394y = (2/5)\u00b7\u0394x\u201d) will give you useful practice.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nA hiking trail begins at the point \\((3,\\,4)\\) and rises with a constant **positive** slope of \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7}{3}\\) (that is, 7 units up for every 3 units forward).\n\n**What is the y\u2011coordinate (height) of the trail when the horizontal distance from the starting point is 12 units?**  \n\n*(In other words, find the\u202f*y* value when the trail has moved 12 units in the\u202f*x\u2011direction from the starting point.)*\n\n**Hints to get you started**\n\n1.
