It\u2019s perfectly fine to feel stuck\u2014what matters is trying to reason through the question.  When a line has a *negative* slope, its\u202f*y*\u2011values decrease as *x* increases.  In algebraic form this means the slope\u202f*m* is a negative number (e.g.,\u202f\u20112,\u202f\u2011\u00bd,\u202f\u20113, \u2026).  Writing an expression for a negative slope usually involves:\n\n1. **Identifying two points** on the line (or a point and a given slope).  \n2. **Using the slope formula** \\(m=\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}\\).  \n3. **Ensuring the result is negative** (the numerator and denominator have opposite signs).\n\nTry to keep those steps in mind as you work on the next problem.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question\n\nA straight road on a map runs downhill from left to right.  \nIt passes through the points **\\(A(2,\\,7)\\)** and **\\(B(5,\\,1)\\)**.\n\n1. **Write the expression for the slope of the line** that contains points\u202f\\(A\\) and\u202f\\(B\\).  \n2. **Calculate the numeric value of the slope** and state whether it is positive or negative.  \n\n*Hint:* Use the slope formula \\(m=\\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\). Pay attention to the order of subtraction; swapping the points changes the signs of both numerator and denominator, leaving the value unchanged.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, give the expression first (you can leave it as a fraction) and then compute the simplified number.
