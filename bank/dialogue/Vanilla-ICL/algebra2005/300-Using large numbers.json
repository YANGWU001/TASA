Even if you\u2019re not sure how to start, it\u2019s still useful to show what you do know\u2014for example, you could write the numbers in column form, line them up by place value, or say \u201cI\u2019ll try to add them.\u201d  Showing any work lets us see where you might be getting stuck and helps us give you the right kind of support.\n\n**How to approach a problem like this**\n\n1. **Write the numbers in a column, aligning the digits by place value** (ones under ones, tens under tens, etc.).  \n2. **Add starting from the rightmost column (the ones)**, carrying over any value\u202f\u2265\u202f10 to the next column on the left.  \n3. Continue column\u2011by\u2011column until you reach the leftmost (the millions) column.\n\nIf you ever feel uncertain, try a single step\u2014like adding just the ones column\u2014and tell me what you get.
