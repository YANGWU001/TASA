In the laboratory we usually record liquids by **volume** (e.g., milliliters, liters) or by **mass** (grams, kilograms) **if a balance is used**.  \n2. **Size of the quantity.**  \n   - In most experiments the amount of liquid nitrogen is **much less than one kilogram**\u2014often only a few milliliters or a few grams. Writing \u201ckilograms\u201d would suggest a huge, unrealistic amount and could lead to confusion.  \n3. **Common practice.**  \n   - Lab notebooks typically use **grams (g)** for small masses or **milliliters (mL)** for volumes. For liquid nitrogen, you\u2019ll most often see something like \u201c30\u202fmL of liquid nitrogen\u201d or \u201c30\u202fg of liquid nitrogen,\u201d not \u201c0.03\u202fkg.\u201d\n\nSo while kilograms *is* a mass unit, it is **too large** for the typical quantities of liquid nitrogen you would record.
