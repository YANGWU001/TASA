However, a more intuitive way is to think of 25% as a quarter of the whole.\n\nImagine you have a pizza that's divided into 4 equal parts. Each part is 25% of the whole pizza. So, if you have 20 units of something and you want to find 25% of it, you can simply divide it into 4 equal parts and take one of them. In this case, one quarter of 20 is 5, but since we're looking for 25% of 20, you'll need to take 5 and multiply it by 2 (because 25% is twice as much as 12.5%). So, 5 \u00d7 2 = 10.\n\nYou were close with your initial calculation, but you overcomplicated it a bit.

In this case, 300 can be thought of as the whole pizza, and 0.75 is like eating 3/4 of it.\n\nLet's try the multiplication method: 300 \u00d7 0.75 = 225. You can also think of it as 300 - (1/4 of 300), since 3/4 of 300 is the same as 1/4 of 300 subtracted from the whole. If you subtract 75 (1/4 of 300) from 300, you'll get 225.\n\nDon't worry if it's still a bit tricky \u2013 it's all part of the learning process. You're getting closer, and with practice, you'll become more confident in your calculations.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question:**\n\nWhat is 25% of 120?\n\n**Options:**\n\nA) 25\nB) 30\nC) 30\nD) 32\nE) 35\n\n**Explanation:** This question requires the student to apply their understanding of percents as a part of a whole and extend it to a more straightforward calculation.\n\nTo find 25% of 120, you can think of it as 1/4 of the whole. Since 25% is equivalent to 0.25 as a decimal, you can simply multiply 120 by 0.25. Let's try that: 120 \u00d7 0.25 = 30.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **B) 30**.",
