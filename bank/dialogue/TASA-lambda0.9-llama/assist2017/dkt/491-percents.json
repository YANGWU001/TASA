I'm here to help you clarify any doubts and build your confidence with percents.\n\nLet's go through the problem you just attempted. You correctly identified that you need to find 40% of 300 gallons. To do that, you multiplied 0.4 by 300, which is indeed 120 gallons. However, you were unsure if you were doing the right thing, and that's completely okay.\n\nWhen working with decimals, it's essential to remember that moving the decimal point is not always the correct approach. In this case, multiplying 0.4 by 300 is the correct way to find 40% of 300.\n\nYour initial answer of 120 gallons is correct, but you were hesitant because you weren't sure if you were doing the right thing. The correct answer is indeed **B) 120 gallons**.\n\nNow, let's move on to the next question to build your confidence and understanding of percents.\n\n**Question:** A book costs $15. If there's a 20% discount, how much will you pay for the book?\n\n**A)** $10\n**B)** $12\n**C)** $12.50\n**D)** $14\n\nTake your time, and think about what 20% off means.\n\n(Remember, we can rewrite 20% as a decimal by dividing 20 by 100, which is 0.20.)",

Let's break down the problem we just attempted together.\n\nYou correctly identified that a 20% discount means taking off one-fifth of the price. However, when you calculated one-fifth of $15, you got $3, and then subtracted $3 from $15, which indeed gives you $12.\n\nThe correct answer is actually **C) $12.50**. To find the price after a 20% discount, you should find 20% of the original price and subtract that from the original price. 20% of $15 is 0.20 \u00d7 $15 = $3. So, the discount is $3, and subtracting that from the original price gives you $15 - $3 = $12. However, you're also supposed to round to two decimal places, which makes the final price $12.50.\n\nLet's try to build your confidence with percents. Here's the next question:\n\n**Question:** A shirt is on sale for 25% off the original price of $25.
