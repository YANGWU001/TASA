You also correctly noted that 63 is divisible by 3, but when you tried to simplify by dividing both numbers by 3, you found that 80 is not a multiple of 3.\n\nHowever, you made a great point that the fraction 63/80 might already be in its simplest form, and that's correct. Since 63 and 80 don't have any common factors other than 1, the fraction 63/80 cannot be simplified further.\n\nYou're doing great, and your understanding of the concept is improving. Keep practicing, and you'll become more confident with multiplying fractions.\n\nHere's the next question to help you build upon your understanding:\n\n**Question:** What is 2/3 \u00d7 6/9?\n\n**Visual aid:** You can use the same visual representation as before or create a new one to help you visualize the multiplication of fractions.\n\n**Guidance:** Remember to multiply the numerators (2 \u00d7 6) and the denominators (3 \u00d7 9) separately, and then simplify the resulting fraction if possible.\n\nTake your time, and let's see how you do!",
