Let's try again, including all three sides: 8 cm + 8 cm + 5 cm = 21 cm.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is not among the choices. This might be another mistake in the question.\n\nBut let's try to find the correct answer by using the information given. We know that the perimeter is the sum of all three sides. \n\n8 cm + 8 cm = 16 cm (correct)\n16 cm + 5 cm = 21 cm (correct)\n\nLet's add the two equal sides and the base together: 8 cm + 8 cm = 16 cm. Then, add the base to that sum: 16 cm + 5 cm = 21 cm.\n\nHowever, the correct answer is not among the choices. We know that 8 + 8 + 5 = 21 cm. So, the perimeter of the triangle is indeed 21 cm.\n\nLet's try another question that's similar but with a different shape. Here it is:\n\n**Question:** What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 9 cm and a width of 6 cm?\n\n**A)** 18 cm\n**B)** 20 cm\n**C)** 22 cm\n**D)** 24 cm\n\nTake your time, and think carefully about the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.
