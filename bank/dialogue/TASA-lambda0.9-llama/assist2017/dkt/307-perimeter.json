The correct formula is P = 2l + 2w, but you've multiplied the sum of the length and width by 2 instead of adding the length and width twice.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The length (l) is 6 cm, and the width (w) is 4 cm.\n2. To find the perimeter, we add the length and width together: 6 cm + 4 cm = 10 cm\n3. Then, we multiply the sum by 2: 2 x 10 cm = 20 cm\n\nHowever, since we are adding the length and width twice, we can simplify the formula to: P = 2(l + w)\n\nUsing this formula, we get: P = 2(6 cm + 4 cm) = 2 x 10 cm = 20 cm\n\nThe correct answer is indeed 20 cm, but it's not among the options. However, we can't choose the closest one as the correct answer. Instead, we should recognize that the correct answer is not listed, and we should understand that the perimeter of the rectangle is actually 20 cm.\n\nLet's move on to the next question, which will help you build your understanding of perimeter.

However, you're overcomplicating the calculation by adding the length and width together first and then doubling the result. \n\nLet's simplify it.

The perimeter of a rectangle is indeed the sum of the lengths of all its sides, which includes two lengths and two widths. This can be broken down into two parts: the sum of the two lengths and the sum of the two widths.\n\nIn this case, the sum of the two lengths is 8 + 8 = 16 cm, and the sum of the two widths is 5 + 5 = 10 cm.
