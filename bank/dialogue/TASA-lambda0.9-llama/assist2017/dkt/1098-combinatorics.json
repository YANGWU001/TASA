However, before we proceed, let's clarify the concept of combinations and the correct calculation for the previous question.\n\nYou initially calculated the combination as \\( \\binom{15}{3} = \\frac{15!}{3!(15-3)!} \\), which is correct.

For the bookshelf problem, we need to find the number of ways to arrange 12 books on 5 shelves, with each shelf holding 3 books.\n\nThis is a stars and bars problem, which is a combinatorial technique used to count the number of ways to distribute objects into bins. We can represent the 12 books as stars and the 4 spaces between the shelves as bars. We need to find the number of ways to arrange 12 stars and 4 bars.\n\nThink of it as placing 4 dividers (bars) among 12 identical items (stars) to separate them into 5 groups (shelves). This is equivalent to choosing 4 positions out of 16 (12 stars + 4 bars) to place the dividers.\n\nUsing the combination formula, we get:\n\n\\( \\binom{16}{4} = \\frac{16!}{4!(16-4)!} = \\frac{16!}{4!12!} \\)\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\n\\( \\binom{16}{4} = \\frac{16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = \\frac{24,360}{24} = 1015 \\)\n\nSo, there are 1015 ways to arrange 12 books on 5 shelves.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nA pizza parlor offers 3 different toppings: pepperoni, mushroom, and olives.

Since the order of the friends matters (i.e., who sits on the left, in the middle, and on the right), we'll use the permutation formula:\n\n\\( P(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \\)\n\nIn this case, n is the total number of friends (3), and k is the number of friends we want to arrange (3).\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n\\( P(3, 3) = \\frac{3!}{(3-3)!} = \\frac{3!}{0!} \\)\n\nTo simplify the expression, we know that 0! is equal to 1, so:\n\n\\( P(3, 3) = \\frac{3!}{1} = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n\nSo, there are 6 different arrangements of the 3 friends.\n\nYour initial answer was **12**, but that's actually the number of combinations (where order doesn't matter), not permutations (where order does matter).
