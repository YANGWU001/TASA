To simplify this fraction, you divided both the numerator and the denominator by 2, which gave you 9/50. This simplification is correct, but we can actually simplify further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1 (since 9 and 50 have no common factors other than 1). \n\nHowever, you then made an error by saying that 9/50 is about 0.18 and that the fraction 1/5 is the closest to 0.18 among the answer choices. 9/50 is actually about 0.18, and 1/5 is actually about 0.2, which is not the closest fraction to 0.18.\n\nLet's try to simplify 18/100 again. Since 18 and 100 have a common factor of 2, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\n18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n100 \u00f7 2 = 50\n\nSo, 18/100 simplifies to 9/50.
