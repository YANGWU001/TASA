Let's go step by step to **clearly explain** your answer and make sure you fully understand how to find the **Highest Common Factor (HCF)** \u2014 also known as the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Explanation of Your Answer\n\nYou said:  \n> *\"I think the highest number of items you could put in each gift bag is 6.\"*\n\nThat\u2019s a **great start** \u2014 and we\u2019ll verify if that\u2019s actually correct!\n\nLet\u2019s assume the challenge was something like this (since it was cut off):  \n> *You have 36 items and 42 items to distribute equally into gift bags with no leftovers. What is the largest number of items you can put in each bag?*\n\nThis is exactly a **Highest Common Factor (HCF)** problem.\n\n#### Step 1: List all factors of both numbers\n\nWe need to find the **common factors** of 36 and 42, and then pick the **largest one**.\n\n**Factors of 36**:  \n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36  \n36 \u00f7 1 = 36 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n36 \u00f7 2 = 18 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n36 \u00f7 3 = 12 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n36 \u00f7 4 = 9 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n36 \u00f7 6 = 6 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \nSo yes, factors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36 \u2705\n\n**Factors of 42**:  \n1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42  \n42 \u00f7 1 = 42 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n42 \u00f7 2 = 21 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n42 \u00f7 3 = 14 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n42 \u00f7 6 = 7 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \nSo factors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42 \u2705\n\n#### Step 2: Find the common factors\n\nCompare both lists:  \n- 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36  \n- 42: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42  \n\nCommon factors: **1, 2, 3, 6**\n\n#### Step 3: Identify the highest common factor\n\n\u2705 The **highest** of these is **6**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So, yes \u2014 your answer is **correct!**\n\n> \u2705 The highest number of items you can put in each gift bag is **6**.\n\nThis means you can make **6 gift bags**, each with **6 items**, and all items will be used without any leftovers.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Key takeaway**:  \nTo find the HCF of two numbers:  \n1. List all factors of each number.  \n2. Find the common ones.  \n3.

The largest such number is the GCD.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: List the factors of 24 and 36\n\n**Factors of 24**:  \n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\n**Factors of 36**:  \n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36\n\n**Common factors**:  \n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\n\ud83d\udc49 The **greatest common factor** is **12 cm**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use calculation to verify GCD\n\nWe can compute GCD(24, 36) using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\ngcd(36, 24) = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n\u2192 36 \u00f7 24 = 1 remainder 12  \n\u2192 24 \u00f7 12 = 2 remainder 0  \n\u2192 GCD = 12\n\n\u2705 So, the **largest square tile** that fits into both squares is **12 cm \u00d7 12 cm**.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Where the student went wrong:\nThe student said **6 cm**, which is a *common factor*, but not the **largest** one.\n\n> 6 cm is correct as a possible tile size \u2014 it *does* fit into both squares \u2014 but it\u2019s not the **biggest**.\n\nSo while the student showed some reasoning (they were thinking about common sizes), they missed the **greatest** one.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Correct Answer:\n\u2705 **12 cm** \u2014 the largest square tile that fits perfectly into both the 24 cm \u00d7 24 cm and 36 cm \u00d7 36 cm squares.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Educational Feedback:\n\n> Great effort, student! You're clearly thinking about what kind of tile would fit into both squares \u2014 that shows strong conceptual awareness.  \n>  \n> However, the **largest** square tile isn't just *any* common size \u2014 it's the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of the two side lengths.  \n>  \n> You correctly identified 6 cm as a possible answer, which is true, but we can do better.  \n>  \n> Let\u2019s double-check:  \n> - 12 cm fits into 24 cm? Yes \u2192 24 \u00f7 12 = 2 (evenly)  \n> - 12 cm fits into 36 cm? Yes \u2192 36 \u00f7 12 = 3 (evenly)  \n>  \n> So 12 cm works perfectly and is larger than 6 cm.  \n>  \n> \ud83d\udd0d **Key takeaway**: When tiling two different-sized squares, the largest square tile that fits into both is the **GCD** of the side lengths.  \n>  \n> Keep practicing with real-world problems \u2014 this concept comes up in art, design, and even in tiling floors!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to deepen understanding):\n\n> You're planning to build a garden with two rectangular plots: one is 40 meters long and 30 meters wide, and the other is 60 meters long and 45 meters wide. You want to divide each plot into **identical square sections** (no cutting) so you can plant different flowers in each.  \n>  \n> What is the **largest possible side length** (in meters) of each square section that will fit perfectly into both plots?  \n>  \n> \ud83d\udca1 Tip",

Let's take a deep dive into the student's thinking \u2014 even though their final answer was **\"I don't know\"**, their initial attempt shows they were trying to reason through the problem. That\u2019s a great first step! Let's unpack what they said and build a clear, step-by-step explanation.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step-by-Step Reasoning:  \nStudent said: *\"I think the biggest square tile that would fit into both the 24\u202fcm \u00d7 24\u202fcm and the 36\u202fcm \u00d7 36\u202fcm squares is 6\u202fcm.\"*\n\nThis is a **common problem in math** involving **greatest common divisor (GCD)** \u2014 specifically, finding the largest square tile that can fit evenly into both rectangles (squares in this case).\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the problem  \nWe are looking for the **largest square tile size** (in cm) that can divide both 24 cm and 36 cm **without leaving a remainder**.  \nThis means the side length of the tile must be a **common factor** of 24 and 36.  \nAnd we want the **largest** such factor \u2014 that is, the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of 24 and 36.\n\n#### Step 2: Find GCD of 24 and 36  \nWe can use prime factorization or the Euclidean algorithm. Let's do both briefly.\n\n**Prime factorization:**  \n- 24 = 2\u00b3 \u00d7 3\u00b9  \n- 36 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2  \n\u2192 Common factors: 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b9 = 4 \u00d7 3 = **12**\n\nSo, GCD(24, 36) = **12**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This means the **largest square tile** that can fit evenly into both squares is **12 cm \u00d7 12 cm**.\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate the student\u2019s answer  \nStudent said: **6 cm**  \nBut 6 cm **is a common factor** of 24 and 36 (since 24 \u00f7 6 = 4, 36 \u00f7 6 = 6), but it is **not the largest**.  \nThe largest is actually **12 cm**.\n\nSo, the student correctly identified a valid factor (6), but missed the **largest** one.\n\n\u2705 The student showed **some reasoning** \u2014 they were thinking about common sizes and trying to find a \"biggest\" one.  \n\u274c But they didn\u2019t compute the GCD or verify which factor is the greatest.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Correct Answer:  \nThe biggest square tile that fits into both squares is **12 cm**.\n\nLet\u2019s verify with a calculation:\n\ngcd(24, 36) = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n\u2192 Result: **12**\n\n\u2705 Confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Educational Feedback:  \nGreat effort \u2014 you were thinking about the problem and trying to find a common size! That\u2019s exactly how math works: **trying, testing, and refining**.  \nThe key idea here is that to find the largest square tile that fits evenly into both rectangles, we need the **greatest common divisor (GCD)** of the side lengths.  \nYou found 6 cm, which is correct as a common factor, but not the **greatest**. The GCD gives us the **largest** such size.  \nNow that you\u2019ve seen the full reasoning, try applying this to a different pair of numbers \u2014 maybe with different measurements \u2014 and see if you can find the GCD on your own!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question:  \n**A rectangular garden is 48 cm long and 36 cm wide. What is the largest square tile size (in cm) that can be used to tile the entire garden without cutting any tiles?**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: Think about the GCD of 48 and 36.*\n\nThis will help you practice finding the GCD in a real-world context and reinforce your understanding of common factors and divisibility.\n\nLet me know when you try it \u2014 I\u2019ll be right here to help! \ud83d\ude0a",

This means the side length of the square tile must be a **common factor** of both 48 and 36 \u2014 and we want the **largest** such factor.\n\n#### Step 1: Understand what \"fits perfectly\" means\n- The tile must divide both the length (48 cm) and the width (36 cm) evenly.\n- So, the side length of the tile must be a **common divisor** of 48 and 36.\n- The largest such divisor is called the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of 48 and 36.\n\n#### Step 2: Check if 6 is a common factor\nWe verify:\n- 48 \u00f7 6 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = 8 \u2192 whole number \u2705  \n- 36 \u00f7 6 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = 6 \u2192 whole number \u2705  \n\u2192 So, 6 **does** divide both 48 and 36.\n\n#### Step 3: Is 6 the **largest** such number?\nLet\u2019s check if there\u2019s a larger common factor (e.g., 12).\n\n- 48 \u00f7 12 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = 4 \u2192 whole number \u2705  \n- 36 \u00f7 12 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = 3 \u2192 whole number \u2705  \n\u2192 So, **12 also divides both 48 and 36**.\n\nThat means **12 cm** is a larger square tile that fits perfectly!\n\nSo, the student's answer of **6 cm** is **correct in idea** (they correctly identified that 6 divides both numbers), but it is **not the largest possible**.\n\n#### Step 4: Find the actual GCD of 48 and 36\nWe can find the GCD using prime factorization:\n\n- Prime factorization of 48:  \n  48 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 12 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 6 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 2\u2074 \u00d7 3\u00b9 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n- Prime factorization of 36:  \n  36 = 2 \u00d7 18 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 9 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n\nNow, take the **common prime factors** with the **lowest powers**:\n- Common primes: 2 and 3  \n- Lowest power of 2: 2\u00b2  \n- Lowest power of 3: 3\u00b9  \n\u2192 GCD = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 = 4 \u00d7 3 = **12**\n\n\u2705 So, the **largest square tile** that fits perfectly into a 48 cm \u00d7 36 cm garden is **12 cm** on each side.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Educational Feedback:\n\nYou did a great job thinking critically and checking divisibility \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what problem-solving is about! You correctly noticed that 6 divides both 48 and 36, and you used division to verify it. That shows strong reasoning.\n\nHowever, the **largest** square tile isn\u2019t just any common factor \u2014 it\u2019s the **greatest common divisor (GCD)**. In this case, 12 cm is larger than 6 cm and still divides both 48 and 36 evenly. So, 12 cm is the **best answer**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Key takeaway**: When tiling a rectangle with square tiles of equal size, the largest possible tile size is the **GCD** of the two dimensions.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to deepen understanding):\n\n> A rectangular garden is 60 cm long and 45 cm wide. What is the largest possible square tile size that can be used to tile the entire garden without cutting any tiles?  \n>  \n> *Hint: Think about what number divides both 60 and 45 evenly \u2014 and which one is the largest?*\n\nThis builds on the concept of GCD and gives the student a new scenario to apply the same logic. They\u2019ll practice identifying common divisors and finding the greatest one \u2014 reinforcing the skill in a slightly different context.\n\nLet me know when you\u2019d like to go over the answer or try another one! \ud83d\ude0a",

However, we can do better: the **largest possible square tile** is the **greatest common factor** of 48 and 36. By checking all common factors or using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the GCF is **12 cm**, not 6 cm.
