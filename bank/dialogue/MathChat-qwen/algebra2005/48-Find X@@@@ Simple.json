This is a valuable signal in the learning process. It may reflect several possible underlying reasons:\n\n1. **Lack of clarity in the problem** \u2013 The student might not be sure what operation or expression is being asked.  \n2. **Mistake in interpreting the question** \u2013 Perhaps they misread the numbers or operations (e.g., thinking it's 3 \u00d7 5 + 5 = 20 when it might actually be something else).  \n3. **Inadequate confidence or prior experience** \u2013 The student may have struggled with similar problems before and is avoiding answering due to fear of making a mistake.  \n4. **Need for more scaffolding** \u2013 They may need a structured breakdown of the steps to build confidence.\n\n> In the initial example, the tutor incorrectly stated that *3 \u00d7 5 + 5 = 20*, which is **false**.  \n> Let's verify that with a calculator:\n\n3 * 5 + 5 = 20  \n\u2192 15 + 5 = **20** \u2705  \nSo the original tutor's claim is actually **correct** \u2014 3 \u00d7 5 + 5 = 20.\n\nBut the student said **\"I don't know\"** \u2014 which suggests they are not relying on the correct calculation but instead are uncertain or trying to reason through it without confidence.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udcda Educational Feedback:\n\nIt's completely okay to say *\"I don't know\"* \u2014 in fact, it's a sign of intellectual honesty and a healthy part of the learning process. However, when we say \"I don't know,\" it's often helpful to ask ourselves:\n\n- What do I know about this problem?\n- What steps should I take to figure it out?\n- Can I break it down into smaller parts?\n\nFor example, in the expression **3 \u00d7 5 + 5**, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\n1. Multiply first: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15  \n2. Then add: 15 + 5 = 20  \n\nSo the correct answer is **20**, not 28 or 26.\n\nThis shows that even if the student doesn't immediately know the answer, they can still use reasoning and step-by-step logic to arrive at it.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Takeaway**: Saying \"I don't know\" is not failure \u2014 it's a starting point. The next step is to **break the problem into manageable parts**, use known rules (like order of operations), and verify each step.\n\n---\n\n#### \u2705 Next Question:\n\nTo build confidence and reinforce the concept of order of operations, here's a well-structured next problem:\n\n> **Solve: 4 \u00d7 3 + 2 \u00d7 5**  \n>  \n> *Hint: Remember to do multiplication before addition. What do you get when you multiply first, and then add?*\n\nThis question allows the student to:\n- Apply multiplication first (PEMDAS),\n- Practice combining multiple operations,\n- Build confidence in solving similar problems,\n- Reflect on whether they might have made a mistake earlier.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore a more challenging or worded version of the next question! \ud83d\ude80",
