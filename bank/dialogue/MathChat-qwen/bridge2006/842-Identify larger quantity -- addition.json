The key is to practice simple expressions step by step and always go left to right when only addition and subtraction are involved. In this case, $ 12 - 4 + 6 $ equals **14**, not 2 or 16.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Next Question:\n\nWhat is the value of $ 8 + 3 - 5 $?  \nTry solving it step by step, and remember: do the operations from left to right.  \n\nLet me know your answer, and I\u2019ll walk you through it! \ud83d\ude0a",
