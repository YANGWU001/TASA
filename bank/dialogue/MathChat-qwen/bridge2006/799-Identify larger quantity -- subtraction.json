For example, if Jar B has 50 marbles, then Jar A would have 50 + 21 = 71 marbles.\n\n**Step 2: Is this answer reasonable?**  \nYes \u2014 the statement is mathematically valid and clearly expresses a relationship between two quantities. It does not require any calculation to be true; it's a relational claim (like a difference). So, if the student is being asked to *state* how many more marbles one jar has than another, saying \"21 more\" is a correct and appropriate response.\n\n**Step 3: Can we verify this with a sample?**  \nLet\u2019s suppose:\n- Jar B has 35 marbles  \nThen Jar A would have:  \n35 + 21 = 56 = 56 marbles  \n\nSo, Jar A has 56 marbles, Jar B has 35 \u2192 difference = 56 - 35 = 21 \u2705  \nThis confirms the statement is consistent.\n\n**Step 4: What might the student be thinking?**  \nThe student may have observed a visual or numerical difference in the jars (e.g., in a diagram or given numbers), and concluded that the difference is 21. This shows good observational and reasoning skills.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Educational Feedback:**  \nGreat job! You correctly identified the difference between the two jars. Saying \"Jar A has 21 more marbles than Jar B\" is a clear and accurate way to express a comparative quantity.

You correctly applied the concept that \"more than\" means addition. To strengthen your reasoning, always try to state the full context \u2014 for example, \u201cI think Jar A has 70 marbles because Jar B has 49 and Jar A has 21 more.\u201d This helps avoid confusion and ensures clarity in math problems.

Is Jar A equal to Jar B + Jar C? Is there a pattern like doubling?).\n\n3. **Why the student said \"I don't know\"**  \n   - The student may have recognized that the problem lacks a clear rule or missing information (e.g., no statement about how Jar A relates to the others).  \n   - They might not have fully processed the relationship between the jars or may have stopped due to uncertainty.  \n   - This is a *valid* and *reasonable* response if the problem statement is incomplete or ambiguous.\n\n4. **Educational insight**  \n   - Saying \"I don't know\" is not a failure \u2014 it reflects critical thinking and self-awareness.  \n   - It shows the student is recognizing when information is missing or when reasoning is incomplete.  \n   - This is an important skill in problem-solving: knowing when to pause, ask for clarification, or re-express the problem.\n\n\u2705 **Feedback to the student:**  \nYou're right to say \"I don't know\" \u2014 that shows you're thinking carefully! In math problems, it's okay to not have all the pieces. If the relationship between the jars isn't clearly stated (like how Jar A compares to Jar B or C), then we can't compute a definite answer. However, if the problem says something like \"Jar A has 10 more than Jar B\" or \"Jar A is twice Jar C,\" we can solve it. Let's clarify the problem \u2014 what is the relationship between the jars?

How many marbles are there in total?\"\n\nEven though the student said *\"I don't know,\"* the tutor provides the necessary values and completes the calculation, implying that the student may have been missing the key information or not recognized that the total could be found by adding the two quantities.\n\n**Educational Insight:**  \nThe student\u2019s answer of *\"I don't know\"* reflects a lack of confidence or incomplete understanding of the problem. In math problems, especially those involving addition or combining quantities, it's essential to identify known values and determine what is being asked. In this case, the student failed to recognize that the total number of marbles could be found by adding the two known values.\n\n**Correct approach:**  \n- Identify known values: Jar A = 21, Jar B = 35  \n- Determine the operation: Total = 21 + 35  \n- Perform the calculation: 21 + 35 = 56  \n\n\u2705 Therefore, the correct total number of marbles is **56**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Next Question:\n\n**A bag contains 18 blue marbles and 27 red marbles. How many marbles are in the bag altogether?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *This question reinforces addition of known quantities and builds confidence in solving similar problems.*  \n\nTry solving it step-by-step before checking the answer!",
