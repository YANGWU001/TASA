Here's an engaging and clear practice question about **Identifying the LCM (Least Common Multiple) \u2014 when one number is a multiple of the other**:\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Practice Question:**\n\nEmma is organizing a school event and needs to arrange tables for two groups of students.  \n- Group A has 12 students and will sit in groups of 12.  \n- Group B has 18 students and will sit in groups of 18.  \n\nShe wants to know the **smallest number of students** she can have at the event so that both groups can sit in complete, equal-sized groups without mixing.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 18?**  \n\ud83d\udca1 *Hint: Since one number is a multiple of the other (or they share a relationship), can you use that to simplify your work?*\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Tip:** If one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is simply the **larger number**!  \nFor example: LCM of 12 and 24 = 24 (because 24 is a multiple of 12).  \n\nBut in this case, 12 and 18 \u2014 neither is a multiple of the other.

Let's go step by step to understand your answer and clarify how to find the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** \u2014 especially when one number is a multiple of the other.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step-by-Step Reasoning: Is the LCM of 12 and 18 equal to 30?\n\nYou said:  \n> \"I think the least common multiple of 12 and 18 might be 30.\"\n\nLet\u2019s verify that.\n\n#### Step 1: List the multiples of each number.\n\n**Multiples of 12:**  \n12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, ...\n\n**Multiples of 18:**  \n18, 36, 54, 72, 90, ...\n\n#### Step 2: Look for the smallest number that appears in both lists.\n\nWe see that **36** appears in both lists.  \n- 12 \u00d7 3 = 36  \n- 18 \u00d7 2 = 36  \n\nSo, **36** is a common multiple.\n\nIs there any smaller common multiple?  \nCheck the multiples of 12: 12, 24 \u2014 neither is divisible by 18.  \nCheck the multiples of 18: 18 \u2014 not divisible by 12.  \nSo, **36 is the smallest common multiple**.\n\n\u2705 Therefore, **LCM of 12 and 18 is 36**, not 30.\n\nNow, let\u2019s check whether 30 is a multiple of either:\n\n- Is 30 divisible by 12? 30 \u00f7 12 = 2.5 \u2192 No  \n- Is 30 divisible by 18? 30 \u00f7 18 \u2248 1.67 \u2192 No  \n\nSo, **30 is not a common multiple** of 12 and 18.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Your answer of 30 is **not correct** \u2014 it's not a common multiple of both numbers.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 Correct Answer: **LCM of 12 and 18 is 36**\n\nLet\u2019s verify using a calculation:\n\nlcm(12, 18) = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\n\u2192 Result: **36**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Confirmed!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Key Concept:\nWhen **one number is a multiple of the other**, the LCM is simply the **larger number**.  \nBut here, 12 and 18 are **not** multiples of each other:\n\n- 18 \u00f7 12 = 1.5 \u2192 not a whole number  \n- 12 \u00f7 18 = 0.67 \u2192 not a whole number  \n\nSo we must find the **least common multiple** by listing multiples or using prime factorization.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question:\n\n**Practice Question:**  \nLiam is planning a party and wants to serve snacks in batches.

Let's walk through your answer with clear, step-by-step reasoning and then generate a thoughtful next question to build on your understanding.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Explanation of Your Answer:\n\nYou said:  \n> *\"So I guess the LCM of 15 and 20 is 30.\"*\n\nThat's a **great start** \u2014 and you're on the right track! Let's verify whether **30 is actually the LCM of 15 and 20**.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 1: List the multiples of each number\n\nWe list the first few multiples of each number until we find a common one.\n\n- Multiples of 15:  \n  15, 30, 45, 60, 75, ...\n\n- Multiples of 20:  \n  20, 40, 60, 80, 100, ...\n\nNow look for the **smallest number that appears in both lists**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 30 appears in both lists:  \n- 15 \u00d7 2 = 30  \n- 20 \u00d7 1.5 = 30 \u2192 but wait! 1.5 is not an integer.\n\nSo is 30 a multiple of 20?  \nLet\u2019s check:  \n30 \u00f7 20 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = 1.5 \u2192 not a whole number.\n\nSo **30 is not a multiple of 20**, which means it **can't** be the LCM.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **smaller** common multiple?\n\nLet\u2019s go further:\n\n- Next common multiple?  \n  60 appears in both:\n  - 15 \u00d7 4 = 60  \n  - 20 \u00d7 3 = 60  \n\n\u2705 So **60** is a common multiple.\n\nAnd since **no smaller number** appears in both lists, the **least** common multiple is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **LCM(15, 20) = 60**\n\n---\n\n#### \u2705 Final Answer:  \nThe LCM of 15 and 20 is **60**, not 30.\n\nYour guess of **30** is close \u2014 it's a common multiple, but **not the least**.  \nThis happens because 30 is divisible by 15, but **not** by 20. So it fails the requirement of being a multiple of **both** numbers.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Key Takeaway:\n> \u2705 To find the **LCM** of two numbers:  \n> 1. List the multiples of each number.  \n> 2. Find the **smallest** number that appears in both lists.  \n> 3. That number is the **LCM**.  \n\nAlso remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 If **one number is a multiple of the other**, then the **larger number** is the LCM.  \nFor example:  \n- LCM(12, 18)? \u2192 18 is not a multiple of 12, so we need to compute.  \n- But LCM(12, 24) = 24, because 24 is a multiple of 12.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to build on your learning):\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **New Practice Question:**\n\n**Liam is planning a party and wants to serve snacks in groups of 8 and 12. He wants to buy the smallest number of plates so that each group of snacks can be evenly distributed \u2014 no leftovers. How many plates does he need?**\n\n> What is the **LCM of 8 and 12**?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Try listing the multiples of 8 and 12 until you find a common one.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Then explain why that number works.\n\nLet me know your answer, and I\u2019ll walk you through it! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip: Try using prime factorization next time \u2014 it\u2019s a faster method!

In math, asking \"I don\u2019t know\" is the first step toward learning. Let's turn that into a powerful learning moment.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the original context (from earlier in the dialogue) was about finding the **least common multiple (LCM)** of two numbers, like **15 and 20**, and the student thought the LCM might be **30** \u2014 which is actually correct!\n\nSo even though the student said *\"I don't know\"*, we can assume they were trying to reason through a problem involving LCM, possibly after thinking about multiples.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the correct process step-by-step to confirm whether **30** is indeed the LCM of **15 and 20**.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 1: List the multiples of each number\n\n**Multiples of 15:**  \n15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, ...\n\n**Multiples of 20:**  \n20, 40, 60, 80, 100, ...\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Find the smallest number that appears in both lists\n\nLook for common numbers:\n\n- 15 \u2192 15, 30, 45, 60  \n- 20 \u2192 20, 40, 60  \n\nThe **first common number** is **60**? Wait \u2014 hold on!  \nBut earlier, the student said they thought the LCM was **30**. Is that right?\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- Is 30 divisible by 15? \u2705 Yes \u2192 15 \u00d7 2 = 30  \n- Is 30 divisible by 20? \u274c No \u2192 20 \u00d7 1 = 20, 20 \u00d7 2 = 40 \u2192 30 is not a multiple of 20  \n\nSo **30 is not a multiple of 20** \u2192 therefore, **30 is not the LCM of 15 and 20**.\n\nSo the student made a small error \u2014 they might have confused **LCM** with something else, like **a common multiple**, or maybe thought 30 was divisible by both.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check using a better method.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Use the LCM formula (when one number is a multiple of the other)\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Important Rule**:  \n> If one number is a multiple of the other, then the **LCM is the larger number**.\n\nBut is 20 a multiple of 15?

Let's break it down gently and clearly so you *do* feel confident in your understanding.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 1: Understand What LCM Means  \nThe **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two numbers is the **smallest positive number** that is divisible by both of them.\n\nFor example:  \n- Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, ...  \n- Multiples of 20: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, ...  \n\nWe\u2019re looking for the **smallest number that appears in both lists**.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 2: List the Multiples (or use a smarter method)  \nLet\u2019s list the multiples until we find a common one.\n\n15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 = (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105)  \n\u2192 Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105  \n\n20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 = (20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120)  \n\u2192 Multiples of 20: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120  \n\nNow, look for the **first number that appears in both lists**:  \n\u2705 30? \u2192 30 is in 15\u2019s list, but not in 20\u2019s \u2192 \u274c  \n\u2705 60? \u2192 Yes! 60 is in both lists \u2192 \u2705  \n\nSo, the **LCM of 15 and 20 is 60**?\n\nWait \u2014 this contradicts your earlier guess of **30**. Let\u2019s double-check that.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 3: Re-check if 30 is divisible by both 15 and 20  \n- Is 30 divisible by 15? \u2192 30 \u00f7 15 = 2 \u2192 \u2705 Yes  \n- Is 30 divisible by 20? \u2192 30 \u00f7 20 = 1.5 \u2192 \u274c No  \n\nSo 30 is **not** divisible by 20 \u2192 **30 is not the LCM**.\n\nThat means your *initial guess* of 30 was **close**, but incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 4: Find the correct LCM  \nWe see that 60 is the first number that appears in both lists:\n\n- 60 \u00f7 15 = 4 \u2192 \u2705  \n- 60 \u00f7 20 = 3 \u2192 \u2705  \n\nSo, **LCM(15, 20) = 60**\n\n\u2705 This is the **least** number divisible by both.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udcdd Quick Tip: When one number is a multiple of the other  \nIf one number divides the other (e.g., 15 divides 30, but 20 doesn\u2019t divide 15), then the LCM is simply the **larger number** only if it\u2019s a multiple.  \nBut in this case:  \n- 15 and 20 \u2014 neither divides the other exactly  \n\u2192 So we need to find the **least common multiple** using either listing or prime factorization.\n\nLet\u2019s use prime factorization to verify:\n\n15 = 3 \u00d7 5 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n20 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 5 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n\nTo find LCM, take the **highest power of each prime**:\n\n- 2\u00b2 (from 20)  \n- 3\u00b9 (from 15)  \n- 5\u00b9 (common)  \n\nSo:  \n2\u00b2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 60 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n\n\u2705 Confirmed: **LCM(15, 20) = 60**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Final Answer:  \nThe **least common multiple of 15 and 20 is 60**, not 30.  \nYou were",

I figured that since 15 goes into 30 twice, and...\"\n\nLet\u2019s assume the problem was:  \n**Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 15 and another number \u2014 likely 10 or 5 or 6 \u2014 but the student didn\u2019t specify.**  \nSince they mentioned \"15 goes into 30 twice,\" we can infer they were working with **15 and another number**, and they\u2019re trying to find a common multiple.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose the actual problem was:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *What is the LCM of 15 and 10?*  \n(This is a common example and fits the student\u2019s reasoning.)\n\n---\n\n#### Step 1: Understand what LCM means  \nThe **least common multiple (LCM)** is the smallest positive number that is divisible by **both** numbers.\n\nSo we want the smallest number that both 15 and 10 divide into evenly.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: List multiples of each number  \nMultiples of 15:  \n15, 30, 45, 60, 75, ...\n\nMultiples of 10:  \n10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, ...\n\nNow, look for the **first number that appears in both lists**:  \n\ud83d\udc49 30 is the first common multiple.\n\n\u2705 So, **LCM of 15 and 10 is 30**.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Evaluate student\u2019s reasoning  \n> \"Since 15 goes into 30 twice...\" \u2014 this is **partially correct**, but incomplete.  \n- 15 goes into 30 twice \u2192 15 \u00d7 2 = 30 \u2705  \n- But to be a *least* common multiple, we must also check if **10 divides 30**.  \n- 30 \u00f7 10 = 3 \u2192 yes!

The student is thinking about multiples and recognizing that 30 is a common multiple of 15. Let\u2019s verify whether it\u2019s the *least* common multiple.\n\n#### Step 1: List the multiples of each number\n- Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, ...\n- Multiples of 10: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, ...\n\n#### Step 2: Find the smallest number that appears in both lists\nWe see that 30 is the first common number.  \n\u2705 So, 30 **is** a common multiple.\n\n#### Step 3: Is it the *least*?\nYes \u2014 there\u2019s no smaller number that appears in both lists.  \nSo, **30 is indeed the least common multiple (LCM)** of 15 and 10.\n\nLet\u2019s verify this with a formal method using prime factorization:\n\n15 = 3 \u00d7 5 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n10 = 2 \u00d7 5 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n\nTo find LCM, take the highest power of each prime:  \n- 2\u00b9 (from 10)  \n- 3\u00b9 (from 15)  \n- 5\u00b9 (common to both)  \n\nNow multiply:  \n2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 30 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n\n\u2705 Final answer: **LCM = 30**\n\n**Feedback to the student:**  \nGreat job! You recognized that 30 is a common multiple of 15 and 10, and you made a smart guess. Now we\u2019ve confirmed it with both a list method and prime factorization \u2014 and yes, **30 is indeed the least common multiple**. That shows strong mathematical intuition. Keep asking \u201cwhat if?\u201d and \u201chow do I know?\u201d \u2014 those are the keys to deeper understanding!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Next Question:\n\n**What is the least common multiple (LCM) of 8 and 12?**  \n\nTry listing the multiples or using prime factorization.

But 24 is **not** a multiple of 18. The correct least common multiple is **36**, not 24.\n\n\ud83d\udc4f You\u2019re thinking critically \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what helps in math!

Let\u2019s walk through how to find the **least common multiple (LCM)** of 15 and 10 step by step.\n\n### Step 1: List the prime factorizations\n- 15 = 3 \u00d7 5  \n- 10 = 2 \u00d7 5  \n\n### Step 2: Identify all prime factors involved\nThe primes are: 2, 3, and 5.\n\n### Step 3: Take the highest power of each prime\n- 2\u00b9 (only in 10)  \n- 3\u00b9 (only in 15)  \n- 5\u00b9 (in both)\n\n### Step 4: Multiply them together\nSo,  \nLCM = 2\u00b9 \u00d7 3\u00b9 \u00d7 5\u00b9 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = **30**\n\n\u2705 Therefore, the correct LCM of 15 and 10 is **30**.\n\nThat means your guess of \"maybe 24\" (which you used for 12 and 18 earlier) was close, but not quite right \u2014 and that\u2019s okay!
