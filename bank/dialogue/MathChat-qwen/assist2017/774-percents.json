Here's an engaging practice question about percents:\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf89 **Percent Challenge: Shopping for Savings!** \ud83c\udf89\n\nYou're shopping at a store where all items are on sale. A pair of sneakers originally costs $80, but they're on sale for **25% off**.  \n\n**Question:**  \nHow much money will you save on the sneakers? What will be the final price you pay after the discount?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: To find the amount saved, multiply the original price by the percent discount (as a decimal). Then subtract that from the original price to get the final price.*\n\nLet\u2019s calculate it together!  \n80 * 0.25 = 20.0  \n80 - (80 * 0.25) = 60.0\n\nWhat do you get?

It shows curiosity and a willingness to engage, even when the concept is new.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through what might be going on in their thinking:\n\n- Percents can feel abstract at first. The student may not yet understand how to interpret a sale like \"25% off\" or how to calculate a discounted price.\n- Without knowing the original price of the sneakers or the discount rate, they can\u2019t compute a final price or savings.\n- They might also be unsure whether they need to multiply, divide, or add something\u2014common confusion when learning percents.\n\nBut here\u2019s the good part: *not knowing* is a great first step. It means the student is ready to learn!\n\nLet\u2019s build from there with a simple, concrete example.\n\n---\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n\ud83c\udf89 **Percent Challenge: Shopping for Savings!

Let\u2019s go through your answer step by step, clarify the math, and then move on to a new, slightly more challenging question to build your confidence.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Step-by-Step Explanation of Your Answer**\n\nYou said:\n\n> \"I think the discount might be $15 (so I\u2019m doing 80 \u00d7 0.25 and somehow getting 15), and then the sale price would be the original $80 minus that, which would be about $65.\"\n\nLet\u2019s break this down and correct the math carefully.\n\n#### Step 1: What does \"25% off\" mean?\nA 25% discount means you pay **75% of the original price** (because 100% \u2013 25% = 75%).\n\nSo, the **sale price** = original price \u00d7 0.75  \nBut you mentioned **discount = $15**, which is not correct based on 80 \u00d7 0.25.\n\nLet\u2019s compute it properly.\n\n80 * 0.25 = 20.0  \n= 20\n\n\u2705 So, **25% of $80 is $20**, not $15.\n\nThat means the **discount is $20**, not $15.\n\n#### Step 2: What is the sale price?\nNow subtract the discount from the original price:\n\n80 - 20 = 60  \n= 60\n\n\u2705 So, the **sale price is $60**.\n\n#### Step 3: Double-check using 75% of original price\n80 * 0.75 = 60.0  \n= 60\n\n\u2705 Same result!

The original price was $600. After a few months, it went up to $720.\n\nWhat is the **percent increase** in price?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: First find the amount of change (new price \u2013 original price), then divide by the original price, and multiply by 100.*\n\nTry it step by step \u2014 and don\u2019t worry if it feels tricky at first!

Let's walk through the student's answer with clear, step-by-step reasoning and then provide a well-designed next question to build on their understanding.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 1) Explanation of the Student's Answer (with step-by-step reasoning)\n\n**Student's response:**  \n*\"I think the discount might be $15 (so I\u2019m doing 80 \u00d7 0.25 and somehow getting 15), and then the sale price would be the original $80 minus that, which would be about $65.\"*\n\nLet\u2019s break this down carefully and correct any misconceptions.\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the context\nThe original problem (which the student seems to be working on) is likely:\n> A pair of sneakers originally costs $80. They are on sale for 25% off. What is the sale price?\n\nThe student says they\u2019re doing **80 \u00d7 0.25**, which is correct \u2014 that gives the *amount of the discount*.\n\nLet\u2019s compute that:\n\n80 * 0.25 = 20.0  \n= 20\n\n\u2705 So, the **discount is $20**, not $15. The student\u2019s calculation of $15 is incorrect \u2014 perhaps they misremembered or made a small arithmetic error.\n\n#### Step 2: Find the sale price\nTo find the sale price, subtract the discount from the original price:\n\n80 - 20 = 60  \n= 60\n\n\u2705 So, the **sale price is $60**, not $65.\n\n#### Step 3: Clarify the misunderstanding\nThe student said: *\"I\u2019m doing 80 \u00d7 0.25 and somehow getting 15\"* \u2014 this shows a gap in computation.  \nWe know that:\n- 25% of 80 = 20 (not 15)\n- 25% of 80 is one-fourth of 80 \u2192 80 \u00f7 4 = 20\n\nThis is a common mistake \u2014 students sometimes confuse percentages with other fractions or misapply multiplication.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Educational Feedback:**  \nYou're doing great by trying to solve the problem and showing your thinking! You correctly recognized that we need to find a percentage of the original price to get the discount. However, 25% of 80 is **not** $15 \u2014 it's **$20**. That\u2019s a key detail.  \nOnce you know the discount, subtract it from the original price to get the sale price. So:  \n- Discount = 25% of $80 = $20  \n- Sale price = $80 \u2212 $20 = **$60**\n\nGreat job on being honest and engaged \u2014 now let\u2019s build on this with a slightly more complex but still accessible question!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf 2) Next Question (Slightly More Challenging)\n\n\ud83c\udf89 **Percent Challenge: The Mystery Discount!** \ud83c\udf89\n\nA jacket is on sale for **60% off** its original price of **$120**.  \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f What is the amount of the discount?  \n\u27a1\ufe0f What is the sale price of the jacket?\n\n*Hint: First, find 60% of $120 to get the discount. Then subtract it from $120 to find the sale price.*\n\nLet\u2019s go step by step \u2014 you\u2019ve got this!\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip for next time:*  \nWhen solving percent problems:  \n- Identify what you're looking for (discount, sale price, final amount)  \n- Use the formula:  \n  **Percent of a number = (percent as decimal) \u00d7 original number**  \n  Then apply it to the situation.\n\nKeep going \u2014 your confidence is growing! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready to try the next one! \ud83d\ude0a",

Saying *\"I don\u2019t know\"* isn't a failure; it's a sign of active engagement and honest self-assessment. It shows the student is thinking, trying to reason through the problem, and recognizing the gap in their current understanding.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down with clarity:\n\n1. **What might the problem be?**  \n   Given the tutor\u2019s earlier calculation of `80 \u00d7 0.25 = 20`, and then `80 - 20 = 60`, it seems like the problem involves a discount. For example:  \n   *\u201cAn item costs $80, and there\u2019s a 25% discount. What is the final price?\u201d*  \n   In that case:\n   - 25% of $80 = $20 (the discount amount)\n   - $80 \u2212 $20 = $60 (the final price after discount)\n\n2. **Why might the student say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d?**  \n   - They may not be sure what 25% means in terms of multiplication.\n   - They may not know how to subtract a discount from the original price.\n   - They might be confused about whether the discount is applied to the full price or not.\n   - Or they may be overthinking or trying to guess without a clear path.\n\n3. **What\u2019s the value in saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d?**  \n   It opens the door for guided discovery. Instead of jumping to the answer, we can build confidence by walking through each step, asking questions, and letting the student participate. This fosters deeper understanding than simply giving the answer.\n\n4. **How do we respond?**  \n   By validating the student\u2019s honesty and then offering a clear, structured explanation \u2014 like the one above \u2014 while inviting them to try again or ask a follow-up question.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Educational Feedback:\n\n> Great job saying *\"I don\u2019t know!\"* \u2014 that\u2019s exactly how learning begins. It shows you're not just guessing; you're thinking critically. Let\u2019s build on that. In problems involving discounts, we often:\n>\n> - Find the discount amount: multiply the original price by the discount rate (e.g., 25% = 0.25).\n> - Subtract that from the original price to get the final price.\n>\n> In this case:  \n> 80 \u00d7 0.25 = 20 \u2192 discount is $20  \n> 80 \u2212 20 = 60 \u2192 final price is $60  \n>\n> So, the answer is $60.  \n>\n> Now that you understand the steps, try this next question \u2014 it\u2019s a variation with a different discount!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Next Question:\n\n> An item originally costs $120.

      "content": "Absolutely! Let's take the student's response \u2014 *\"Um\u2026 I think the discount is 20% of $120. Maybe\"* \u2014 and turn it into a meaningful learning opportunity. Even though the student didn't give a final answer, the fact that they are *making an attempt* to reason about the problem shows strong engagement. Let's walk through their idea with clarity, check its validity, and build from there.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Explanation of the Student's Answer:\n\n**Student's idea:** *\"I think the discount is 20% of $120. Maybe.\"*\n\nThis is a **great start** \u2014 the student is recognizing that a discount is a percentage of the original price. That shows understanding of the core concept.\n\nLet\u2019s verify if this makes sense.\n\nWe are given:\n- Original price = $120  \n- Discount rate = 20%\n\nTo find the **amount of the discount**, we compute:\n\n120 * 0.20 = 24.0  \n= 24\n\nSo, the discount is **$24**.\n\nNow, if the student says \"Maybe,\" that suggests uncertainty \u2014 which is completely normal and valuable. Let\u2019s explore what happens next.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Is $24 a reasonable discount?  \nYes \u2014 20% of $120 is $24. That\u2019s a standard calculation and matches typical retail discounts.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 What if the question had been: \"What is the final price after the discount?\"  \nThen we\u2019d subtract:  \n120 - 24 = 96  \n= 96  \n\nSo the final price would be **$96**.\n\nBut the student only mentioned the discount amount \u2014 which is correct and on the right track.\n\n\u2705 **Educational Feedback:**\nYou're doing great by thinking about percentages of the original price! Recognizing that a 20% discount means 20% of $120 is a solid step. You're applying the right idea \u2014 just need to be precise with the calculation. Let\u2019s double-check:  \n20% of 120 = 0.20 \u00d7 120 = **$24** \u2014 correct.  \nSo yes, the discount is $24. Well done!\n\nNow, to deepen understanding, let's ask a follow-up question that builds on this idea.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Next Question:\n**What is the final price of the item after a 20% discount on a $120 item?**\n\n*(This builds on the student\u2019s correct idea of the discount and requires them to apply it to find the final cost \u2014 reinforcing both computation and real-world application.)*\n\n---\n\nKeep going \u2014 every \"I don't know\" or \"maybe\" is a chance to grow! \ud83d\udca1",

Saying *\"I don't know\"* shows **self-awareness**, **honesty**, and **a willingness to engage** with the problem \u2014 all of which are essential in mathematical thinking.  \n\nRather than avoiding the problem, the student is signaling that they are actively trying to understand, even if they haven\u2019t yet arrived at a clear solution. This is exactly what good problem-solving looks like: **acknowledging uncertainty** and seeking clarity.\n\nNow, let\u2019s build on that. Suppose the original context was: *\"A store offers a 20% discount on an item that costs $120. What is the sale price?\"*  \n\nEven though the student didn\u2019t provide a final answer, their hesitation suggests they are thinking about the concept of percentage discounts. A common misunderstanding might be to apply the percentage directly to the original price (which they *might* have done, as in their earlier attempt with $120 \u00d7 20% = $24), and then subtract it to get the final price.  \n\nLet\u2019s compute it step by step:\n\n1. **Find the discount amount**:  \n   20% of $120 = $120 \u00d7 0.20 = **$24**  \n   120 * 0.20 = 24.0 = 24  \n\n2. **Subtract the discount from the original price**:  \n   $120 \u2212 $24 = **$96**  \n   120 - 24 = 96 = 96  \n\n\u2705 So, the final sale price is **$96**.\n\nThis process teaches students how to break down real-world problems using percentages \u2014 a foundational skill in algebra and financial literacy.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Educational Feedback:\nSaying *\"I don\u2019t know\"* is not a failure \u2014 it\u2019s a **strategic first step** in problem-solving. It shows that you're thinking critically and are not afraid to admit gaps in your knowledge. The next step is to **break the problem into smaller parts** and **use mathematical tools** (like multiplication and subtraction) to find a solution. You're doing great by trying!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question:\nA shirt costs $80 and is on sale for 25% off.
