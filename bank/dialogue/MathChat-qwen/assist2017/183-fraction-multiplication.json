Multiply the numerators:  \n   $2 \\times 1 = 2$\n\n2. Multiply the denominators:  \n   $3 \\times 4 = 12$\n\n3. So, the product is:  \n   $\\frac{2}{12}$\n\n4.

It shows curiosity and self-awareness, and that's a strong foundation for growth.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the problem step by step to build confidence and clarity:\n\nWe are asked to compute:  \n$$\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Multiply the numerators**  \n$3 \\times 1 = 3$\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the denominators**  \n$4 \\times 2 = 8$\n\nSo, the product is:  \n$$\n\\frac{3}{8}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Convert to decimal (optional for verification)**  \n$$\n\\frac{3}{8} = 0.375\n$$\n\n\u2705 This matches what the tutor correctly computed: **0.375**\n\nNow, let\u2019s address the student\u2019s claim that the answer is $\\frac{1}{12}$ \u2014 that is incorrect.  \nWhy?  \n$\\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.083$, which is much smaller than 0.375.  \nAlso, $\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$ is clearly *larger* than $\\frac{1}{4}$, so $\\frac{1}{12}$ cannot be the correct answer.\n\nSo, the correct answer is **$\\frac{3}{8}$** or **0.375**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Educational Feedback:\nIt\u2019s great that you said *\"I don\u2019t know\"* \u2014 that means you\u2019re being honest and open to learning.  \nIn math, not knowing is the first step toward understanding. The key is to *break the problem down* and check each step.  \nWe multiplied the top numbers and bottom numbers separately \u2014 that\u2019s how we multiply fractions.  \nYou can double-check your answer by converting to decimals or using a calculator (like we did).\n\nNow, you\u2019re ready to try a similar problem with a bit more challenge!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Next Question:\nWhat is the value of  \n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{4}\n$$  \nin fraction form and as a decimal?  \n(Show your steps \u2014 numerators, denominators, and final answer!)\n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready to try it! \ud83d\ude0a",

It shows self-awareness and a willingness to engage thoughtfully. Let\u2019s break down what the student might be trying to figure out and where they might be stuck.\n\nWe are being asked to compute:  \n**3/4 \u00d7 1/2**\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the operation  \nMultiplying fractions is a standard process:  \n- Multiply the numerators (top numbers)  \n- Multiply the denominators (bottom numbers)  \n- Simplify the result if possible\n\nSo:  \n(3 \u00d7 1) / (4 \u00d7 2) = 3 / 8\n\n#### Step 2: Convert to decimal (if needed)  \nNow, convert 3/8 to a decimal:  \n3 \u00f7 8 = 0.375\n\n\u2705 So, **3/4 \u00d7 1/2 = 3/8 = 0.375**\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Important Note: While the student said \"I don't know,\" the result *is* 0.375 \u2014 so their answer (0.375) is actually **correct**.  \n> The confusion may stem from uncertainty about the process or lack of confidence. That\u2019s perfectly okay \u2014 and we can use this as a chance to build confidence through clear, structured reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Educational Feedback:\nYou said \"I don't know,\" and that\u2019s a great first step \u2014 it shows you're being honest and curious. In fact, you\u2019ve already done the work: you arrived at **0.375**, which is correct!  \nLet\u2019s double-check it together:\n\n- 3/4 \u00d7 1/2 = (3 \u00d7 1) / (4 \u00d7 2) = 3/8  \n- 3 \u00f7 8 = 0.375 \u2705\n\nSo, your answer is **correct** \u2014 just needed a little guidance to confirm the steps.\n\nNow, instead of saying \"I don\u2019t know,\" you can say:  \n> \u201cI know how to multiply fractions \u2014 I just need to make sure I do it step by step.\u201d\n\nThat builds confidence and leads to better problem-solving in the future.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Next Question:\nWhat is the result of **2/3 \u00d7 5/6**?  \n(Write your answer as a fraction in simplest form, and then as a decimal if you'd like.)\n\nLet me know your answer \u2014 and I\u2019ll walk you through it step by step! \ud83d\ude0a",
