Your reasoning shows you're engaged and making a good effort. However, $95 is a bit high \u2014 it's close, but not quite right. The key is to remember that a 25% discount means you pay 75% of the original price. When we calculate 75% of $120, we get exactly $90. So, the final price is **$90**, not $95.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip: A quick way to estimate:  \n25% of $120 is $30 (since 10% of 120 is $12, so 25% is 3 \u00d7 $12 = $36). Wait \u2014 that\u2019s a mistake! Let\u2019s fix it:\n\nActually:  \n10% of $120 = $12  \n20% = $24  \n25% = $30 (because 25% is 20% + 5%, and 5% is half of 10%, so $12 \u00f7 2 = $6 \u2192 $24 + $6 = $30)\n\nSo, discount = $30 \u2192 Final price = $120 - $30 = **$90**\n\nThat confirms it again: the correct final price is **$90**.\n\n\ud83d\udc4f Keep practicing \u2014 estimation helps, but accuracy matters!\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Question:**  \nYou're at a bookstore and see a novel that costs $18.

A **20% discount** means the customer pays **80%** of the original price (since 100% - 20% = 80%).\n2. To calculate 80% of $150, we use the formula:  \n   **Final Price = Original Price \u00d7 (1 - Discount Rate)**  \n   \u2192 Final Price = 150 \u00d7 (1 - 0.20)  \n   \u2192 Final Price = 150 \u00d7 0.80  \n3.

This suggests they may have approximated the discount incorrectly\u2014perhaps thinking 20% of 150 is about $30, so 150 - 30 = $120, but then maybe miscalculated or rounded down. A common mistake is to underestimate the discount or misapply percentages.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Educational Feedback:**  \nYou're on the right track by thinking about percentages and discounts! The key is to remember that a 20% discount means you pay 80% of the original price. Your estimate of $115 is close, but the exact value is $120. Always double-check your math using multiplication by (1 - discount rate) for accuracy.
