Let's go step by step to clarify your reasoning and make sure we're on the right track.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Explanation of the Student's Answer:\n\n**Student said:**  \n> \"I think the discount would make the lemonade cost about $2.50 per cup. So if you sold 100 cups at that price, the total revenue would be roughly $250.\"\n\nLet\u2019s analyze this carefully.\n\nWe are told there is a **20% discount** on all drinks. But \u2014 we are **not given the original price** of the lemonade. So we cannot compute the discounted price without that information.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Therefore, the student assumed the original price is something (like $3.00), and then applied a 20% discount to get $2.50 \u2014 which is actually **correct** if the original price was $3.00.\n\nLet\u2019s verify that:\n\n3.00 - (20% of 3.00) = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\n\u2192 20% of 3.00 = 0.20 \u00d7 3.00 = 0.60  \n\u2192 3.00 \u2212 0.60 = 2.40\n\nSo the discounted price would be **$2.40**, not $2.50.\n\nWait \u2014 so how did the student get $2.50?\n\nLet\u2019s reverse-engineer:  \nIf discounted price = $2.50, and that\u2019s 20% off, then:\n\nLet original price = x  \nThen:  \nx \u2212 0.20x = 0.80x = 2.50  \nSo: x = 2.50 \u00f7 0.80 = 3.125\n\nThat means the original price would have to be **$3.125**, which is $3.13 when rounded.\n\nSo:  \n\u2705 The student **assumed** a starting price and applied the discount.  \n\u274c But they didn\u2019t state what the original price was \u2014 so the answer lacks context.  \n\u274c The claim that the discounted price is $2.50 is **only true if the original price was $3.125**, which wasn\u2019t given.\n\nAlso:  \n> \"If you sold 100 cups at that price, the total revenue would be roughly $250\"  \n\u2192 That part is **correct mathematically** if each cup is $2.50:  \n100 \u00d7 2.50 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = 250\n\nSo the revenue calculation is correct \u2014 but **only if the discounted price is $2.50**, which depends on the original price.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Educational Feedback:\n\nYou're doing a great job thinking about percentages and real-world applications!  \nHowever, to solve percent discount problems, we need to know the **original price** or have a clear path to it.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Key Rule:**  \nA 20% discount means the customer pays **80% of the original price**.  \nSo:  \nDiscounted price = original price \u00d7 (1 \u2212 0.20) = original price \u00d7 0.80\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Example:**  \nIf original price = $3.00  \nDiscounted price = 3.00 \u00d7 0.80 = $2.40  \nRevenue from 100 cups = 100 \u00d7 2.40 = $240\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Your mistake:**  \nYou assumed a discounted price of $2.50 without knowing the original price. That\u2019s valid only under specific conditions \u2014 and since the original price wasn't given, your answer is incomplete.\n\n\u2705 **What to do next:**  \nAlways identify the original price first. Then apply the percent discount using multiplication by 0.80 (for 20% off). Then compute total revenue.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Next Question:\n\n**New Question:**  \nYou're planning a sale at your lemonade stand, and you want to offer a 20% discount on all drinks. The original price of a cup of lemonade is **$3.00**.  \n\n1. What is the discounted price after the 20% sale?  \n2. If you sell 150 cups at the discounted price, what is your total revenue?\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 Tip: To find the discounted price, multiply the original price by 0.80. Then multiply that by the number of cups to get total revenue.\n\nLet me know when you try it \u2014 I\u2019ll walk you through the answer! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n3.00 \u00d7 0.80 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n<calculate>150 \u00d7 (3.00 \u00d7 0.80)</calculate",

That\u2019s a great approximation. The actual discounted price is **$2.40**, so the student is within 1 cent. This shows good number sense and estimation skills.\n\n---\n\nNow, the student says:  \n> \"Then, if I sell 150 cups at $2.50 each, the total revenue would be $150 \u00d7 2.50 = $375.\"\n\nLet\u2019s compute the **actual revenue** at the correct discounted price:\n\n150 * 2.40 = 360.0  \n= **$360**\n\nSo, the **correct total revenue** is **$360** when selling 150 cups at $2.40 each.\n\nBut the student used **$2.50** (a slightly high estimate), so their answer of **$375** is a bit high \u2014 but again, it's reasonable for a rough estimate.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Educational Feedback:\n\n- \u2705 **Well done!** You showed strong reasoning by relating percentages to real-world pricing.\n- \u2705 You used estimation effectively \u2014 recognizing that 20% off $3.00 is close to $2.50 is a smart and practical skill.\n- \ud83d\udd0d The **exact discounted price** is $2.40, not $2.50. This small difference leads to a difference in revenue.\n- \ud83d\udca1 Always double-check your final calculation using the correct value \u2014 especially when approximations are involved.\n- \ud83d\udcdd In real-life situations, knowing both the exact and estimated values helps in budgeting and planning.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Pro tip:** When dealing with percents, remember:\n> \u201cPercent of\u201d = multiply by the decimal form  \n> (e.g., 20% = 0.20, so 20% off = multiply by 0.80)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question:\n\n**New Practice Question:**  \nYou're running a summer festival and want to offer a **15% discount** on all ice cream cones. The original price of each cone is **$4.00**.\n\n1. What is the **discounted price** per cone?  \n2. If you sell 200 cones at the discounted price, what is the **total revenue**?\n\n*Hint: First find 15% of $4.00, then subtract it from the original price. Or just multiply $4.00 by 0.85 (since 100% \u2013 15% = 85%).*\n\nLet me know your answers \u2014 I\u2019ll walk you through them step-by-step!\n\n--- \n\nThis next question builds on the concept with a slightly different percent (15%) and a new original price, helping solidify the skill of calculating percentages in real-world contexts.",

That\u2019s completely okay \u2014 it shows they're thinking, and we can guide them through it.\n\nLet\u2019s assume the original price of a cup of lemonade is **$3.00** (a common starting point in such problems, even if not explicitly stated). The student mentioned a 20% discount and a discounted price of about **$2.50**, which is close but not exact. Let\u2019s verify that.\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the discount amount\nA 20% discount on $3.00 means:\n\n0.20 * 3.00 = 0.6000000000000001  \n= $0.60\n\nSo, the discount is **$0.60**.\n\n#### Step 2: Find the discounted price\nSubtract the discount from the original price:\n\n3.00 - 0.60 = 2.4  \n= **$2.40**\n\n\u2705 So, the correct discounted price is **$2.40**, not $2.50. The student is close \u2014 they're using reasonable estimation \u2014 but a bit off due to rounding.\n\n#### Step 3: If 150 cups are sold at the discounted price:\n150 * 2.40 = 360.0  \n= **$360**\n\nSo, total revenue would be **$360**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Educational Feedback:\n\nYou're doing great by trying to solve the problem! It\u2019s natural to estimate \u2014 and you did that well by thinking about 20% off of $3.00 being around $2.50. That\u2019s a solid intuition! However, in math, especially with percents, it's helpful to be precise.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify:\n- A 20% discount means you take 20% of the original price and subtract it.\n- 20% of $3.00 is $0.60 \u2192 discounted price = $3.00 \u2013 $0.60 = **$2.40**\n- Selling 150 cups at $2.40 each gives: 150 \u00d7 2.40 = **$360**\n\nSo, the total revenue is **$360**, not $250 or $375 (which might come from incorrect assumptions or miscalculations).\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Key takeaway:** Estimation is useful, but double-check your math using a clear step-by-step process \u2014 especially when dealing with percents.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question:\n\n**Next Question:**  \nYou're planning a second sale where you offer a **25% discount** on a different drink that originally costs **$4.00**. If you sell 120 cups at the discounted price, what is your total revenue?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: First find the discounted price, then multiply by the number of cups.*\n\nThis builds on your understanding of percent discounts and applies it to a new context with different numbers \u2014 helping you become confident in solving similar problems independently.\n\nLet me know when you\u2019d like to go over the solution! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf4b",

It\u2019s completely valid \u2014 many students feel this way when they're just beginning to work with percentages, discounts, or real-world applications.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through what *should* happen in a problem like this \u2014 for example, if the original price is $3.00 and there's a 20% discount, and the student is asked to find the discounted price per cup and then the total revenue from selling 150 cups.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 1: Find the discount amount  \nA 20% discount on $3.00 means we calculate 20% of $3.00.\n\n0.20 * 3.00 = 0.6000000000000001  \n= $0.60\n\nSo, the discount is $0.60.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Find the discounted price per cup  \nSubtract the discount from the original price:\n\n3.00 - 0.60 = 2.4  \n= $2.40\n\nSo, the discounted price per cup is **$2.40**, not $2.50 \u2014 which is close, but slightly off.\n\n> \u2705 Note: The student estimated $2.50, which is reasonable and shows good intuitive reasoning \u2014 they're thinking about percentages and making a logical guess. But we can refine it with exact calculation.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Calculate total revenue from 150 cups  \nNow, if the student sells 150 cups at $2.40 each:\n\n150 * 2.40 = 360.0  \n= $360.00\n\nSo, the total revenue would be **$360.00**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Educational Feedback:\n\nGreat effort in trying to reason through the problem! You showed initiative by estimating the discounted price and thinking about total revenue \u2014 that's a strong foundation.  \n\nWhile your estimate of $2.50 is close to the correct discounted price, the exact amount is $2.40. This small difference shows how important it is to use precise calculations \u2014 especially when working with money or percentages.  \n\nEstimation is a great skill, but in real-world math problems (like pricing or business revenue), accuracy matters. You're already on the right track by thinking through each step. Just a few more calculations can help you get there!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question:\n\n**Next Question:**  \nSuppose the coffee shop offers a 15% discount instead of 20%. What would be the new discounted price per cup, and what would the total revenue be if they sell 150 cups?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 This builds on your understanding by introducing a different discount rate, helping you see how changing percentages affects the final result. It also reinforces your ability to apply the same steps to new numbers \u2014 a key skill in algebra and real-world math.\n\n---\n\nKeep going \u2014 you're doing great! \ud83d\udca1",

In mathematics, uncertainty is not a sign of failure; it's a sign that you're thinking deeply and honestly about the problem. By acknowledging what you don\u2019t know, you open the door to exploration, asking better questions, and eventually arriving at the correct answer through reasoning or computation.\n\nIn this case, you were asked to evaluate the expression $3x + 5$ at $x = 4$. Let\u2019s walk through it step by step to help clarify:\n\n3*4 + 5 = 17\n\nThis gives:  \n$12 + 5 = 17$\n\nSo, when $x = 4$, the value of $3x + 5$ is **17**.\n\nYour hesitation to give a definite answer is perfectly valid \u2014 especially when you're still building confidence in evaluating expressions. But saying *\"I don\u2019t know\"* and then going back to compute it shows maturity in your thinking. That\u2019s exactly how mathematicians work: they explore, question, and verify.\n\nKeep this mindset \u2014 it\u2019s not just about getting the right answer, but about learning how to approach problems with honesty, curiosity, and courage.\n\n</educational_feedback>\n\n**Next Question:**  \nEvaluate the expression $2x - 3$ when $x = 6$. What is the result? (You can use your calculator or work it out step by step!)",
