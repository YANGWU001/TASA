How much will you pay for the shirt after the discount?\n\n**Options:**\n\nA) $30\nB) $34\nC) $36\nD) $38\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n- The discount percentage is relatively small (15%), making it a bit more manageable for the student.\n- The original price is a round number ($40), which makes calculations easier.\n- The question focuses on finding the final price after a discount, which is a common application of the concept.\n\nThis question will help the student build upon their existing knowledge and provide a gentle challenge to improve their understanding of discount.",
