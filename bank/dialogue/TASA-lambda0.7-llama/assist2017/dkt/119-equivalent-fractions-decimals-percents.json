    "content": "Let's go through the solution together.\n\nTo convert the fraction 3/8 to a decimal, we need to divide the numerator (3) by the denominator (8).\n\nTo do this, we can use long division or a calculator. \n\nIn this case, let's use long division:\n\n   0.375\n8 | 3.00000\n\nWe can see that 8 goes into 3 zero times, so we write 0 on top. Then we multiply 8 by 0 and subtract 0 from 3, which gives us 3. We bring down a 0 and add it to 3, making it 30. We can see that 8 goes into 30 three times with a remainder of 6. So we write 3 on top and multiply 8 by 3, which gives us 24. We subtract 24 from 30, leaving us with 6. We bring down another 0 and add it to 6, making it 60. We can see that 8 goes into 60 seven times with a remainder of 4. So we write 7 on top and multiply 8 by 7, which gives us 56. We subtract 56 from 60, leaving us with 4. We bring down another 0 and add it to 4, making it 40. We can see that 8 goes into 40 five times with a remainder of 0. So we write 5 on top.\n\nTherefore, 3/8 = 0.375.\n\nThe correct answer is indeed **B) 0.375**.

We can express 0.625 as 625/1000, and then simplify it.\n\nTo simplify the fraction, we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 625 and 1000. The factors of 625 are 1, 5, 25, 125, and 625. The factors of 1000 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, and 1000.
