Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nGiven the length is 5 cm and the width is 3 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (5 + 3)\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 8\nPerimeter = 16 cm\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D) 16 cm.\n\nThis question is a good starting point because it:\n\n1.

Since a rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the formula for the perimeter is:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nGiven the length is 18 cm and the width is 15 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 (18 + 15)\nPerimeter = 2 \u00d7 33\nPerimeter = 66 cm\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 66 cm.\n\nLet's make sure to focus on the multiplication part of the formula to help the student master it.",
