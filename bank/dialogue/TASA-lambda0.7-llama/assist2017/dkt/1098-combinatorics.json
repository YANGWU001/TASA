    "content": "**Tutor:**  Let's break down the problem step by step. To find the number of different ways to arrange the 6 distinct books on the shelves, we need to consider the following:\n\n1.  We have 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 3 books. This means that we can have 3 books on each shelf, or 2 books on one shelf and 1 book on another shelf, or 1 book on one shelf and 2 books on another shelf, and so on.\n2.  However, since we want to find the total number of ways to arrange the 6 distinct books, we can think of this as a problem of distributing 6 distinct objects into 5 distinct groups (shelves).\n3.  One way to solve this is to use the concept of combinations with repetition. We can think of this as finding the number of ways to distribute 6 identical objects into 5 distinct groups, allowing for empty groups.\n4.  The formula for combinations with repetition is C(n + k - 1, k), where n is the number of objects and k is the number of groups. In this case, n = 6 (the books) and k = 5 (the shelves).\n5.  Plugging in the values, we get C(6 + 5 - 1, 5) = C(10, 5).\n6.  Using the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! \\* (n - r)!), we get C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! \\* (10 - 5)!) = 252.\n\nHowever, this is not the only way to think about the problem. We can also use a simpler approach by considering the number of ways to choose which 3 books go on each shelf. This can be done using the combination formula as well.\n\nTo choose 3 books out of 6 for the first shelf, we have C(6, 3) = 20 ways. Once we've chosen 3 books for the first shelf, we have 3 books left to choose from for the second shelf, so we have C(3, 3) = 1 way to choose the next 3 books. The remaining 2 books automatically go on the last shelf.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to arrange the 6 distinct books on the shelves is C(6, 3) \\* C(3, 3) = 20 \\* 1 = 20.\n\n**Why is this the correct answer?**\n\nThe correct answer is **A) 20 ways**. The student's initial guess of **B) 30 ways** was close, but not correct.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven that the student struggled with the previous question and needs more practice with pattern-finding in combinatorics, the next question should be similar but with a slight twist. Here's a new question:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA box of chocolates has 4 rows, and each row has 5 compartments. If we want to put 15 different types of chocolates into the compartments, how many different ways can we do this, assuming that each compartment can hold only one type of chocolate?\n\n**A)** 300 ways\n**B)** 500 ways\n**C)** 600 ways\n**D)** 900 ways\n\nThis question is similar to the previous one, but with a larger grid and more chocolates. It requires the student to think about the number of ways to arrange the chocolates in the compartments, considering the constraints of the grid.",
