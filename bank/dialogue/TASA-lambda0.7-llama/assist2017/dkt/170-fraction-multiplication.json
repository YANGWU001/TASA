Since both 6 and 20 are divisible by 2, you can divide each by 2 to get 3/10, not 2/5. So, the simplified answer is indeed 3/10.\n\nTo confirm, let's visualize the fractions. Imagine you have 2 groups of 3 equal parts, and each group is divided into 5 equal parts. How many of those equal parts do you have in total? You'd have 3 parts out of 10, which is 3/10.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\nNow that you've successfully solved the first question, let's try another one.

You're absolutely right to multiply the numerators and denominators together:\n\n- Numerator: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18\n- Denominator: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\nHowever, you're struggling to simplify the fraction 18/50. That's okay! Simplifying fractions can be a bit tricky, but it's a crucial skill to master.\n\nTo simplify a fraction, you need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator.
