Here's a suitable first practice question:\n\n**Question:** What is the sum of the interior angles of a triangle?\n\n**Answer choices:**\n\nA) 90\u00b0\nB) 180\u00b0\nC) 270\u00b0\nD) 360\u00b0\n\n**Explanation:** This question assesses the student's basic understanding of the concept. The correct answer is B) 180\u00b0, as the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180\u00b0. This question requires the student to recall a fundamental property of triangles, which is essential for more complex problems.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1.  It's a basic recall question that helps reinforce the student's understanding of the concept.\n2.  It's a simple and straightforward question that doesn't require any complex calculations or problem-solving skills.\n3.  It allows the student to demonstrate their understanding of the concept without feeling overwhelmed or frustrated.\n\n**What to expect:**\n\n*   If the student answers correctly, provide positive reinforcement and move on to more challenging questions.\n*   If the student answers incorrectly, provide a gentle correction and explanation, then move on to more basic questions to reinforce their understanding.",

So, if we add those two angles together, we get:\n\n60\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n\nSince the sum of all three angles is 180\u00b0, we can set up an equation to find the third angle:\n\n140\u00b0 + x = 180\u00b0\n\nTo solve for x, we subtract 140\u00b0 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 180\u00b0 - 140\u00b0\nx = 40\u00b0\n\nSo, the measure of the third angle is actually 40\u00b0, which is answer B) 40\u00b0.

You were correct that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, but you struggled to apply that concept to find the measure of the third angle when two of the angles are given. Don't worry, it's a common challenge, and we can work on it together.\n\nFor the second question, you had a good idea that adding a new angle to a triangle would increase the sum, but you didn't quite get the correct answer. The correct answer is indeed A) The sum would increase to 270\u00b0. When you add a new angle to a triangle, you're essentially creating a new triangle with four angles. The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral (a four-sided shape) is 360\u00b0, not 270\u00b0. However, when you add a new angle to a triangle, you're essentially creating a new triangle with three angles, and the sum of those angles would indeed be 180\u00b0. But, if you add another angle to that new triangle, the sum of all four angles would be 360\u00b0, which is 180\u00b0 + 180\u00b0.\n\nHowever, the question asks what happens to the sum of the interior angles of the original triangle if you add a new angle to it. So, the correct answer is indeed A) The sum would increase to 360\u00b0 for the new quadrilateral, but the sum of the interior angles of the original triangle remains the same at 180\u00b0.\n\nLet's try another question to reinforce your understanding of the concept:\n\n**Question:** What is the sum of the interior angles of a triangle if one angle is 45\u00b0, another angle is 75\u00b0, and the third angle is x\u00b0?\n\n**Answer choices:**\n\nA) 150\u00b0\nB) 180\u00b0\nC) 210\u00b0\nD) 240\u00b0\n\nThink about it for a moment before answering.",
