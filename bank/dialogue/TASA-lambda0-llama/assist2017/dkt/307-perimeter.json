What is the perimeter of the garden?\n\n**Answer choices:**\n\nA) 18 meters\nB) 20 meters\nC) 22 meters\nD) 26 meters\n\nThis question is a good starting point because:\n\n1. It's a basic concept: The student has likely learned about the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (P = 2l + 2w).\n2. It's a straightforward calculation: The student can easily apply the formula to find the perimeter.\n3. It's not too complex: The numbers are relatively small and easy to work with, making it a good starting point for the student to regain their confidence.\n4.

To find the new perimeter, we need to add 1 meter to each side of the playground to account for the path. So, the new length becomes: 18 meters + 1 meter + 1 meter = 20 meters\n3. And the new width becomes: 6 meters + 1 meter + 1 meter = 8 meters\n4. Now, we can find the new perimeter by adding the new length and width: 20 meters + 20 meters + 8 meters + 8 meters = 56 meters\n\nHowever, we're not done yet. We need to consider the path's width, which is 1 meter. To find the new perimeter, we should add 2 meters to each side of the playground for the added width of the path:\n\n- New length: 20 meters + 1 meter + 1 meter = 22 meters\n- New width: 8 meters + 1 meter + 1 meter = 10 meters\n- Then, add the new length and width: 22 meters + 22 meters + 10 meters + 10 meters = 64 meters\n\nSo, the correct answer is **not listed**. Let me give you another hint, and we can try again.\n\nHowever, the new perimeter is actually 64 meters, and this isn't an option. Let's think of it another way: If we add the path's width to each side, we are adding a total of 4 meters to the length and 4 meters to the width. \n\n- Original perimeter: 18 + 18 + 6 + 6 = 48 meters\n- Added perimeter: 4 + 4 = 8 meters\n- New perimeter: 48 meters + 8 meters = 56 meters\n\nHowever, we're not done yet. The path is 1 meter wide, so we need to add 2 meters to each side of the playground for the added width of the path:\n\n- New length: 18 + 2 = 20 meters\n- New width: 6 + 2 = 8 meters\n- Then, add the new length and width: 20 meters + 20 meters + 8 meters + 8 meters = 56 meters\n\nWait, this is the same answer as before. However, the correct answer should be larger than 56 meters, since we added the path's width to each side. Let's try to add the path's width to the original perimeter:\n\n- Original perimeter: 18 + 18 + 6 + 6 = 48 meters\n- Added perimeter: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 meters\n- New perimeter: 48 meters + 8 meters = 56 meters\n\nSince we added 8 meters to the original perimeter, the correct answer should be 8 meters more than the original perimeter. Let's look at the answer choices:\n\nA) 60 meters\nB) 62 meters\nC) 68 meters\nD) 72 meters\n\nThe original perimeter was 48 meters. Let's add 8 meters to the original perimeter:\n\n48 meters + 8 meters = 56 meters\n\nHowever, none of the options match the correct answer. But, if we look at the options, we can see that the answer should be 8 meters more than 48 meters. \n\nA) 60 meters is 12 meters more than 48 meters.\nB) 62 meters is 14 meters more than 48 meters.\nC) 68 meters is 20 meters more than 48 meters.\nD) 72 meters is 24 meters more than 48 meters.\n\nSince we need to add 8 meters to the original perimeter, the correct answer is actually not listed. However, if we look at the options, we can see that option D) 72 meters is 24 meters more than 48 meters, which is the closest answer.\n\nHowever, since we need to add 8 meters to the original perimeter, the correct answer is actually **not listed**. But, if we look at the options, we can see that the closest answer is 72 meters, but we need to subtract 8 meters from the correct answer.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we can subtract 8 meters from the largest option: 72 meters - 8 meters = 64 meters.\n\nThe correct answer is **not listed**, however the closest answer is 64 meters.",

This means the length gets 2 meters longer (1 meter on the left and 1 meter on the right) and the width also gets 2 meters longer.\n\nSo, the new dimensions are:\n\n- Length: 18 + 2 = 20 meters\n- Width: 6 + 2 = 8 meters\n\nHowever, we're not done yet. To find the new perimeter, we need to add the new length and width, and also add 2 meters to the new length and 2 meters to the new width to account for the path's width:\n\nNew length: 20 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 24 meters\nNew width: 8 meters + 2 meters + 2 meters = 12 meters\n\nNow, we can find the new perimeter by adding the new length and width:\n\n24 meters + 24 meters + 12 meters + 12 meters = 72 meters\n\nHowever, we made a mistake earlier. Let's re-evaluate the problem.\n\nThe original perimeter is 48 meters. To find the new perimeter, we need to add 4 meters to the original perimeter, not 8 meters. We added 2 meters to the length and 2 meters to the width to account for the path's width.\n\nSo, the correct new perimeter is:\n\n48 meters + 4 meters = 52 meters\n\nHowever, this is not among the options.
