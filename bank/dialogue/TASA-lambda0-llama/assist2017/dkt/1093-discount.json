    "content": "Given the student's limited mastery of the concept and moderate forgetting score, it's essential to create a question that's neither too easy nor too difficult. A well-crafted question will help the student build confidence and reinforce their understanding.\n\nHere's a suitable first practice question:\n\n**Question:** \n\nOriginal price of a shirt is $25. If there's a 15% discount, how much will you pay for the shirt?\n\n**Options:**\n\nA) $21.25\nB) $22.50\nC) $20.00\nD) $21.00\n\n**Explanation:** To solve this question, the student will need to apply the discount concept by calculating 15% of $25 and then subtracting that amount from the original price. This will help them practice the concept and build their problem-solving skills.\n\nThis type of question will allow the student to apply the discount concept in a straightforward manner, making it an ideal starting point for their practice.",

Let's break down your thought process for the third question.\n\nYou correctly found 15% of $120, which is $18, by multiplying $120 by 0.15 (since 15% is equal to 15/100 or 0.15). However, you got a bit mixed up with the subtraction part. You correctly subtracted $18 from $120 to get $102, but then you started to doubt yourself and considered different possibilities.\n\nLet's focus on the correct calculation:\n\n$120 - $18 = $102\n\nYou're correct that if you use 0.14 instead of 0.15, the calculation would be different, but that's not the case here. Similarly, using 0.13 would give you a different result as well.\n\nThe correct answer is indeed A) $102.00.\n\nNow, let's try another question to reinforce your understanding of the discount concept.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA shirt is originally priced at $85. If there's a 30% discount, how much will you pay for the shirt?\n\n**Options:**\n\nA) $59.50\nB) $59.00\nC) $60.00\nD) $60.50\n\nTake your time, and let's see how you do.\n\nTo help you, I'll give you a hint: think about what 30% of $85 is, and then subtract that from the original price.\n\nAlso, remember that 30% is equal to 30/100 or 0.30.\n\nThink about how you can calculate 30% of $85 and then subtract that from $85 to find the correct answer.",
