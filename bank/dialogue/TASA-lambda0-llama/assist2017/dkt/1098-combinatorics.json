Let's go back to the basics.\n\nTo find the total number of combinations of 3 balls from 15 balls, we can use the combination formula:\n\n\\( \\binom{15}{3} = \\frac{15!}{3!(15-3)!} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 455 \\)\n\nHowever, this is not the correct answer. We want to find the number of combinations where we have both red and blue balls. Let's think about it from a different perspective.\n\nWe can calculate the number of combinations where all 3 balls are red, which is \\( \\binom{8}{3} = 56 \\). We can also calculate the number of combinations where all 3 balls are blue, which is \\( \\binom{7}{3} = 35 \\).\n\nTo find the total number of combinations where we have both red and blue balls, we can subtract the sum of these two cases from the total number of combinations of 3 balls from 15 balls:\n\n\\( \\binom{15}{3} - \\binom{8}{3} - \\binom{7}{3} = 455 - 56 - 35 = 364 \\)\n\nHowever, this is still not the correct answer.\n\nLet's think about it one more time. What if we consider the cases where we have exactly 1 red ball and 2 blue balls, or exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball, or exactly 3 red balls and 0 blue balls, or exactly 0 red balls and 3 blue balls?\n\nWe can calculate the number of combinations for each of these cases:\n\n- Exactly 1 red ball and 2 blue balls: \\( 8 \\times \\binom{7}{2} = 8 \\times 21 = 168 \\)\n- Exactly 2 red balls and 1 blue ball: \\( \\binom{8}{2} \\times 7 = 28 \\times 7 = 196 \\)\n- Exactly 3 red balls and 0 blue balls: \\( \\binom{8}{3} = 56 \\)\n- Exactly 0 red balls and 3 blue balls: \\( \\binom{7}{3} = 35 \\)\n\nNow, we add up the number of combinations for each case:\n\n168 + 196 + 56 + 35 = 455\n\nWait, this is the correct answer!

    "content": "Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nTo find the total number of arrangements of 12 books on 5 shelves, we can consider the following approach:\n\n1.  We have 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 3 books. This means that we can fill the first shelf with 3 books, the second shelf with 3 books, and so on.\n2.  However, we have a total of 12 books, and we need to find the number of arrangements of these 12 books on the 5 shelves.\n3.  One way to approach this problem is to consider the number of ways to select 3 books for each shelf, and then arrange the remaining books.\n4.  Let's start by selecting the first book for the first shelf. There are 12 choices for the first book.\n5.  Once we have selected the first book, there are 11 remaining books to choose from for the second book on the first shelf. \n6.  For the third book on the first shelf, there are 10 remaining books to choose from.\n7.  After filling the first shelf, we have 9 books remaining. We can select the first book for the second shelf from these 9 books.\n8.  Once we have selected the first book for the second shelf, there are 8 remaining books to choose from for the second book on the second shelf.\n9.  We continue this process for the remaining shelves, selecting one book from the remaining pool of books for each shelf.\n10.  However, this approach overcounts the number of arrangements, as the order in which we select the books on each shelf does not matter.\n11.  A more efficient way to approach this problem is to consider the number of ways to select 3 books from the 12 available books for each shelf, and then arrange the remaining books.\n\nLet's consider the first shelf. We need to select 3 books from the 12 available books. This can be done in \\( \\binom{12}{3} \\) ways.\n12.  Once we have selected 3 books for the first shelf, we have 9 remaining books. We need to select 3 books from these 9 books for the second shelf, which can be done in \\( \\binom{9}{3} \\) ways.\n13.  We continue this process for the remaining shelves, selecting 3 books from the remaining pool of books for each shelf.\n14.  However, this approach still overcounts the number of arrangements, as the order in which we select the books on each shelf does not matter.\n15.  A more efficient way to approach this problem is to use the concept of combinations with repetition.\n\nLet's use the concept of combinations with repetition to find the number of arrangements of 12 books on 5 shelves. We can select 3 books from the 12 available books for each shelf, allowing for repetition.\n\nThe number of ways to select 3 books from the 12 available books for each shelf is \\( \\binom{12+3-1}{3} = \\binom{14}{3} \\).\n16.  We have 5 shelves, so we need to raise this value to the power of 5 to account for the repetition.\n\nThe number of arrangements of 12 books on 5 shelves is \\( \\binom{14}{3}^5 \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate this value.\n\n\\( \\binom{14}{3} = \\frac{14!}{3!(14-3)!} = \\frac{14 \\times 13 \\times 12}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 364 \\)\n\n\\( \\binom{14}{3}^5 = 364^5 \\)\n\n\\( 364^5 = 78,364,164,096 \\)\n\nSo, there are 78,364,164,096 different arrangements of 12 books on 5 shelves.\n\nLet's try another question.

    "content": "That's a great start. Your approach is correct. You're considering each topping as an independent choice, and since a pizza can have at most 3 toppings, you're multiplying the number of choices together.\n\nTo make this more precise, we can break it down into cases:\n\n1.  A pizza with 0 toppings: There's only 1 way to make a pizza with 0 toppings (i.e., choosing none).\n2.  A pizza with 1 topping: There are 5 ways to choose 1 topping from the 5 available toppings.\n3.  A pizza with 2 toppings: There are \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\) ways to choose 2 toppings from the 5 available toppings.\n4.  A pizza with 3 toppings: There are \\( \\binom{5}{3} \\) ways to choose 3 toppings from the 5 available toppings.\n\nWe can then sum up the number of ways for each case:\n\n1 (pizza with 0 toppings) + 5 (pizza with 1 topping) + \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\) (pizza with 2 toppings) + \\( \\binom{5}{3} \\) (pizza with 3 toppings)\n\nLet's calculate the values:\n\n1 (pizza with 0 toppings) + 5 (pizza with 1 topping) + \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\) (pizza with 2 toppings) + \\( \\binom{5}{3} \\) (pizza with 3 toppings) = 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 = 26\n\nHowever, your original approach is also correct, and we can simplify it as you mentioned:\n\n\\(5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^3 = 125\\)\n\nThe reason why this works is that we're counting the number of ways to choose up to 3 toppings. Since each topping can be either included or not included, we have 2 choices for each topping. So, for 3 toppings, we have \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) choices, and for 2 toppings, we have \\( 2^2 = 4 \\) choices, and for 1 topping, we have \\( 2^1 = 2 \\) choices, and for 0 toppings, we have \\( 2^0 = 1 \\) choice.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose up to 3 toppings is \\( 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 \\), but we can also think of it as \\( 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 15 \\).\n\nHowever, we can also think of it as simply choosing up to 3 toppings, which can be done in \\( 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^3 = 125 \\) ways.\n\nSo, both approaches are correct, and the total number of different pizzas that can be made with at most 3 toppings is indeed 26 or 125.",
