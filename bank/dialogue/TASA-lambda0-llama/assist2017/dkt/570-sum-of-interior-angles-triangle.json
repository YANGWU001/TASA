Let's break it down together.\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a triangle is a fixed value that remains the same for all triangles, regardless of their size or shape. This value is 180\u00b0. However, in this specific question, we are given two of the angles and need to find the third angle. \n\nTo find the third angle, we can subtract the sum of the two given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle, which is 180\u00b0. \n\nGiven angles: 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0\n\nFirst, let's add the two given angles: 45\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 105\u00b0\n\nNow, let's subtract the sum of the two given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle: 180\u00b0 - 105\u00b0 = 75\u00b0\n\nSo, the third angle of the triangle is 75\u00b0.

You're right that the two angles we're given are 30\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, but the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180\u00b0, not just the sum of the two angles we're given.\n\nLet's use the same method we used in the previous question. We know the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, and we're given two of the angles: 30\u00b0 and 90\u00b0. To find the third angle, we can subtract the sum of the two given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle: 180\u00b0 - (30\u00b0 + 90\u00b0).\n\nFirst, let's add the two given angles: 30\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 120\u00b0\n\nNow, let's subtract the sum of the two given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle: 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0\n\nSo, the third angle of the triangle is 60\u00b0. And since we found the third angle, we can confirm that the sum of the interior angles of the triangle is indeed 180\u00b0, which is the fixed value for all triangles.\n\nNow that you've practiced this, let's try a new question that's slightly more challenging.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180\u00b0, no matter what the size or shape of the triangle is. When we're given two angles, we can use this fact to find the third angle by subtracting the sum of the two given angles from 180\u00b0.\n\nIn this case, we're given two angles: 55\u00b0 and 70\u00b0.

Then, subtract the sum of the two given angles from the total sum of the interior angles of a triangle: 180\u00b0 - 125\u00b0 = 55\u00b0\n\nSo, the third angle of the triangle is 55\u00b0, and since we found the third angle, we can confirm that the sum of the interior angles of the triangle is indeed 180\u00b0.\n\nThe reason your initial answer was incorrect is that you forgot to subtract the sum of the two given angles from 180\u00b0. Instead, you just added the two angles together, which gives you the sum of the two angles, not the sum of all three angles.\n\nDon't worry, you're getting closer, and I'm here to help you practice until you feel confident with this concept.
