Percent means per 100. So, we're looking for the number that, when multiplied by 100, gives us 60.\n\nThink of it like this: if we have 60 cookies in a jar, and we want to know what percent of the cookies are in the jar, we would say that 60 is a certain percent of 120 cookies. Since there are 120 cookies in the jar, and 60 of them are in the jar, we can say that 60 is what percent of 120.\n\nTo find the answer, we can use a simple ratio: 60 is to 120 as x is to 100. We can set up a proportion to solve for x: 60/120 = x/100. \n\nTo solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 60 * 100 = 120 * x. This gives us 6000 = 120x.
