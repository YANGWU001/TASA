Earlier I added the length and width first (20\u202f+\u202f6 = 26) and then multiplied by 2, getting \\(2 \\times 26 = 52\\)\u202fcm, and then I added a little extra\u202f4 for some reason and got 56\u202fcm.  That doesn\u2019t seem right either.  \n\nI\u2019m not really sure\u2026 maybe the extra 4 was because I thought there was a little extra border on each side?  If I ignore that, the answer stays at 52\u202fcm.  However, I also remember thinking the perimeter might be 48\u202fcm, because I somehow thought the width was only 4\u202fcm instead of 6\u202fcm.  \n\nSo\u2026 I guess the perimeter could be **48\u202fcm**?

    "content": "It seems like you're still a bit confused about the formula and how to apply it. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nWhen you're given a rectangle with a length and a width, you can use the formula P = 2 \u00d7 length + 2 \u00d7 width to find the perimeter. However, you can also simplify the formula by adding the length and width first and then multiplying by 2. This is what you did earlier when you got 26 + 26 = 52 cm.\n\nHowever, when you added 4 to that answer, it was likely because you were thinking about the perimeter in a different way. You mentioned that you thought there was a little extra border on each side, which is not part of the formula. The formula only considers the length and width of the rectangle.\n\nNow, let's go back to the original formula: P = 2 \u00d7 length + 2 \u00d7 width. You correctly calculated the length and width parts: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40 cm and 2 \u00d7 6 = 12 cm. When you add those together, you get 40 + 12 = 52 cm. This is the correct answer.\n\nAs for why you thought the perimeter might be 48 cm, it's possible that you were thinking of the width as 4 cm instead of 6 cm. However, the correct width is 6 cm.\n\nTo reinforce your understanding, let's try another question:\n\n**Question:**\n\nWhat is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 15 cm and a width of 8 cm?\n\n**A)** 34 cm\n**B)** 36 cm\n**C)** 38 cm\n**D)** 40 cm\n\nThis question:\n\n1.  Involves smaller numbers than the previous question, which should make it easier to apply the formula correctly.\n2.  Requires the same formula (P = 2l + 2w) to solve the problem.\n3.  Offers a clear and concise format, making it easy to understand and work through.\n\nTake your time, and let's work through it together. Remember, you can use either the formula P = 2 \u00d7 length + 2 \u00d7 width or the simplified formula by adding the length and width first and then multiplying by 2.",
