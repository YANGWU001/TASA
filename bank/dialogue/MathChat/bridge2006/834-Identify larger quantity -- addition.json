Let\u2019s walk through the reasoning you used (and fill in any missing steps) so you can see exactly why the answers you gave are the right ones.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Which library has more books?  \n\n| Library | Number of books |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| **A**  | 134 |\n| **B**  | 219 |\n\nTo decide which is larger we simply compare the two numbers.  \n\n219\u202f\u2212\u202f134 = 85 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nBecause the difference is a positive 85, **Library\u202fB** has **85 more books** than Library\u202fA. So the larger quantity is **Library\u202fB (219 books)**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Which orchard has more apples?  \n\n| Orchard | Number of apples |\n|---------|------------------|\n| **X**   | 165 |\n| **Y**   | 142 |\n\nAgain we compare the two numbers.  \n\n165\u202f\u2212\u202f142 = 23 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nThe result is a positive 23, meaning **Orchard\u202fX** has **23 more apples** than Orchard\u202fY. Therefore the larger quantity is **Orchard\u202fX (165 apples)**.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which number is larger?  \n\n| Number | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| **M**  | 3,402 |\n| **N**  | 3,398 |\n\n3\u202f402\u202f\u2212\u202f3\u202f398 = 4 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSince the difference is 4 (a positive number), **M = 3,402** is larger than **N = 3,398**.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Which amount of money is greater?  \n\n| Person | Amount (\\$) |\n|--------|------------|\n| **Sam**| 68 |\n| **Lee**| 73 |\n\n<calculate>73\u202f\u2212\u202f68",
