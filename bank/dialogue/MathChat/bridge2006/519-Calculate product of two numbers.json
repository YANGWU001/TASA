If we know how many batches are baked, we can find the total number of chocolate cupcakes by **multiplying** the two numbers:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cupcakes} = (\\text{cupcakes per batch}) \\times (\\text{number of batches})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Write the multiplication in algebraic form.**  \n   Let  \n\n   * \\(c = 27\\) (cupcakes per batch)  \n   * \\(b =\\) number of batches  \n\n   Then  \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cupcakes}=c \\times b = 27 \\times b\n   \\]\n\n3. **Plug in the given number of batches.**  \n   In the example you mentioned, the bakery bakes **2 batches**.

That\u2019s perfectly fine \u2013 it\u2019s the first cue that we need to break the problem into smaller, manageable pieces.\n\n2. **Identify the information given**  \n   - The bakery makes **27 chocolate cupcakes per batch**.  \n   - We need to know **how many batches are baked each day** to find the total number of chocolate cupcakes.\n\n3. **Determine what is missing**  \n   The problem does not yet give the number of batches. That is the *unknown* we must solve for (or be given) before we can multiply.\n\n4. **Formulate a question to fill the gap**  \n   Ask yourself (or the problem) something like:  \n   *\u201cHow many batches of chocolate cupcakes does the bakery bake each day?\u201d*  \n\n5. **Apply the multiplication once the missing number is known**  \n   If, for example, the bakery bakes **4 batches** a day, the total would be:  \n\n   27\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 = 108 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n\n   So the bakery would make **108 chocolate cupcakes** that day.\n\n6. **Check your work**  \n   - Does the multiplication use the correct numbers?  \n   - Does the answer make sense in the context (e.g., is 108 a reasonable daily output for a small bakery)?\n\n7. **What to do next**  \n   Since the number of batches is the piece you\u2019re missing, look back at the original problem statement or any accompanying information. If it truly isn\u2019t provided, the problem might be asking you to **express the total in terms of the number of batches** (let\u2019s call that *b*). In that case, the answer would be:  \n\n   27\u202f\u00d7\u202fb = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]  \n\n   which you can leave as an algebraic expression until *b* is known.\n\n---\n\n### Next",
