The general form of its \\(n\\)\u2011th term is  \n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d,\n\\]\n\nwhere  \n\n* \\(a_1\\) = first term,  \n* \\(d\\) = common difference,  \n* \\(n\\) = term number (starting at 1).\n\n### 1. Identify the first term \\(a_1\\)\n\nFrom the list \\(5,\\;12,\\;19,\\;26,\\;33,\\dots\\) the very first term is  \n\n\\[\na_1 = 5.\n\\]\n\n### 2. Find the common difference \\(d\\)\n\nPick any two successive terms and subtract the earlier one from the later one.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n12-5 &= 7,\\\\\n19-12 &= 7,\\\\\n26-19 &= 7,\\\\\n33-26 &= 7.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nAll give the same result, so  \n\n\\[\nd = 7.\n\\]\n\n(You could also write this as a quick calculation: 12-5 = 7 = 7.)\n\n### 3. Write the formula\n\nPlug \\(a_1 = 5\\) and \\(d = 7\\) into the generic formula:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_n &= 5 + (n-1)\\cdot 7\\\\\n    &= 5 + 7n - 7\\\\\n    &= 7n - 2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSo the \\(n\\)\u2011th term is  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{a_n = ",
