Isolate the Variable on One Side  \nThe usual strategy is to move all terms containing \\(x\\) to one side and all constant terms to the other side. You do this by adding or subtracting the same quantity from **both** sides\u2014just as you would with an equation.\n\n1. **Subtract\u202f\\(2x\\)** from both sides to gather the \\(x\\)-terms:  \n   \\[\n   3x - 7 - 2x \\;\\le\\; 2x + 5 - 2x\n   \\]  \n   This simplifies to  \n   \\[\n   3x - 2x = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] - 7 \\;\\le\\",
