The garden\u2019s **length** will be **exactly 7\u202fm** and the **width** will be **approximately 4.3\u202fm** (the exact width is a rational number that cannot be written as a terminating decimal).  \n\nAnswer the following, showing your reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the type of each quantity**  \n   a. The length of 7\u202fm \u2013 is it an integer, a rational number, an irrational number, or a whole\u2011number?  \n   b. The exact width (the rational number you haven\u2019t written yet) \u2013 what type is it?  \n\n2. **Give a clear name (variable) for each quantity** that you would use in an algebraic expression for the garden\u2019s area. Write the expression for the area using those variable names.\n\n3. **Estimate the garden\u2019s area** using the approximate width of 4.3\u202fm.  \n   - Compute the estimate and round your answer to the nearest whole square meter.  \n\n   7 * 4.3 = 30.099999999999998  \n\n4. **Refine the estimate** by using the exact width as a fraction. The exact width is \\(\\dfrac{43}{10}\\)\u202fm.  \n   - Compute the exact area using the fraction and then give a decimal approximation rounded to one decimal place.  \n\n   7 * (43/10) = 30.099999999999998  \n\n5. **Explain the difference** between the two results (the",
