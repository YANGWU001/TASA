Locate point\u202fA** | Mark the endpoint of AB that will be the vertex **A** (the point where the given angle will be placed). | The angle \u2220BAC is measured at A, so we need a clear reference for that vertex. |\n| **3. Construct the given angle** | With a protractor (or a compass\u2011based angle\u2011construction method), place the center at **A**, align one leg of the angle along **AB**, and mark a ray that makes **45\u00b0** with AB. | This ray will be the direction of side **AC**. |\n| **4. Mark the length of AC** | From point **A**, measure **9\u202fcm** along the 45\u00b0 ray you just drew and place point **C** there. | This satisfies the second given side (AC = 9\u202fcm). |\n| **5.

Pause and reflect** | \u201cAsk yourself what part of the problem feels weird.\u201d | A short pause prevents you from rushing into random guesses. Reflection lets you retrieve relevant prior knowledge and notice patterns or hidden assumptions. |\n| **3.
