Your reasoning was on the right track\u2014you correctly recognized that we need to apply a 25\u202f% discount and then subtract $10. The small discrepancy comes from the arithmetic:\n\n- 25\u202f% of $120 is $30 (not $35).  \n- $120\u202f\u2013\u202f$30 = $90, and $90\u202f\u2013\u202f$10 = $80.\n\nSo the correct final price is **$80**, not $85. Great effort! Double\u2011checking each arithmetic step, as we did with the `<calculate>` tags, helps catch these tiny slips.\n\n---\n\n## Next question\n\nA pair of shoes is listed for **$150**.
