Let\u2019s work together to see why the slope of the walkway is \\(\\frac12\\) and how you can find it on your own next time.\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011Step Reasoning\n\n1. **What does \u201crise\u202ffor every run\u201d mean?**  \n   The *rise* is the vertical change, and the *run* is the horizontal change. A statement such as \u201crise\u202f\u00bd unit for every 1 unit of run\u201d tells us exactly how much the line goes up when it moves one unit to the right.\n\n2. **Translate the words into a fraction.**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{slope} = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{\\tfrac12\\ \\text{unit}}{1\\ \\text{unit}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction.**  \n   Because the denominator is 1, the fraction is already in simplest form:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\tfrac12}{1}= \\frac12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Interpret the result.**  \n   A slope of \\(\\frac12\\) means that for every 2 units you move horizontally, the line rises 1 unit; equivalently, for each single unit of horizontal movement, the line rises half a unit.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Check with a Calculator (just for practice)\n\nIf you wanted to confirm the numerical value, you could ask a calculator:\n\n0.5 / 1 = 0.5\n\nThe calculator would return **0.5**, which is the decimal form of \\(\\frac12\\).\n\n---\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nUnderstanding slope as \u201crise over run\u201d lets you:\n- **Write the equation of a line** when you know a point and its slope.\n- **Compare steepness** of different lines (a larger numerator or smaller denominator makes a steeper line).\n- **Solve real\u2011world problems** like the garden walkway, ramps, or roofs.\n\n---\n\n## Next Question\n\nNow that",
