Use the formula to calculate the perimeter of this rectangle.  \n\n*Show your work step\u2011by\u2011step (you can write the calculations in a notebook or on a piece of paper before checking your answer).*\n\n---  \n\n**Hint:**  \nThe perimeter of a rectangle is the total distance you would travel if you walked once around its outside edges. Think about how many times each side length appears in that walk.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, compare your answer to the solution below.\n\n---  \n\n**Solution (for you to check after you\u2019ve tried):**  \n\n1. Formula:\u2003\\(P = 2 \\times (\\text{length}) + 2 \\times (\\text{width})\\) \u2003or\u2003\\(P = 2(L + W)\\)  \n2.

Write the formula** | \\(P = 2L + 2W\\) | The perimeter of any rectangle is the sum of the four sides, which we can group as two lengths\u202f+\u202ftwo widths. |\n| **2. Plug in the garden\u2019s dimensions** | \\(P_{\\text{garden}} = 2(12) + 2(7) = 24 + 14 = 38\\)\u202fm | Multiplying first (the \u201cmultiply\u2011before\u2011add\u201d rule) gives the contribution of each pair of opposite sides. Adding them gives the total distance around the garden. |\n| **3. Add a 2\u2011m walkway all around** | \u2013 New length: \\(12 + 2 + 2 = 16\\)\u202fm<br>\u2013 New width : \\(7 + 2 + 2 = 11\\)\u202fm | The walkway adds 2\u202fm on the left **and** 2\u202fm on the right \u2192\u202f+\u202f4\u202fm total to the length, and the same on top\u202f+\u202fbottom for the width. |\n| **4. Compute the new perimeter** | \\(P_{\\text{new}} = 2(16) + 2(11) = 32 + 22 = 54\\)\u202fm | Same formula, just with the larger dimensions. |\n\n**Result:**  \n\n- Original garden perimeter = **38\u202fm**  \n- Garden\u202f+\u202fwalkway perimeter = **54\u202fm**\n\nBoth numbers check out if you list the sides explicitly:\n\n- Original: \\(12 + 12 + 7 + 7 = 38\\)  \n- With walkway: \\(16 + 16 + 11 + 11 = 54\\)\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely on the right track! \ud83c\udf89\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 Next practice problem \u2013 \u201cPerimeter Puzzle\u201d\n\n> **A rectangular playground is 15\u202fm long.**  \n> 1. The **total perimeter** of the playground is 62\u202fm.  \n> 2. Find the width of the playground.  \n> 3. If a 1\u2011m wide fence is built **outside** the playground (so the fence forms a larger rectangle), what is the perimeter of the fence?\n\n### How to approach it (step\u2011by\u2011step hints)\n\n1. **Write the perimeter formula** with the unknown width \\(W\\).  \n   \\[\n   P = 2L + 2W\n   \\]\n2. **Plug in what you know** ( \\(L = 15\\)\u202fm and \\(P = 62\\)\u202fm ) and solve for \\(W\\).  \n   \\[\n   62 = 2(15) + 2W \\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad 2W = 62 - 30\n   \\]\n3. **Divide** to get the width.  \n4. **Add the fence**: a 1\u2011m fence around all four sides adds 2\u202fm to the length (1\u202fm left\u202f+\u202f1\u202fm right) and 2\u202fm to the width (top\u202f+\u202fbottom).  \n   \\[\n   L' = 15 + 2,\\qquad W' = W + 2\n   \\]\n5. **Compute the new perimeter** with the same formula \\(P' = 2L' + 2W'\\).\n\n---\n\n### Your turn\n\nWrite out each step on a piece of paper (or in the chat) and tell me:\n\n1.

    "content": "**Awesome \u2013 thanks for sending over your work!** \ud83c\udf89  \n\nI\u2019m looking forward to seeing the two lines you wrote (the \u201cfence\u2011perimeter equation\u201d with the numbers plugged in). Could you copy\u2011paste them here so I can give you quick feedback?  \n\n---\n\n### Meanwhile, let\u2019s peek at your patio attempt  \n\nYou mentioned you tried part\u202f(a) of the patio problem. Could you show me **exactly** what you wrote for the perimeter of the patio?  \nFor example, you might have something like:\n\n1.\u202fWrite the formula \\(P = 2L + 2W\\).  \n2.\u202fPlug in the numbers \\(L = 9\\)\u202fm and \\(W = 5\\)\u202fm.  \n3.\u202fDo the arithmetic and give the final answer.\n\nIf you already have those steps, just type them out (or type the final number you got).  \n\n---\n\n### What I\u2019ll do next  \n\n* **Check your two lines** \u2013 I\u2019ll let you know if the algebra is spot\u2011on or if there\u2019s a tiny tweak to make.  \n* **Review your patio work** \u2013 we\u2019ll verify the calculation together, and if anything feels shaky, we\u2019ll break it down step\u2011by\u2011step.  \n* **Move on to part\u202f(b)** \u2013 once part\u202f(a) is solid, we\u2019ll add the walkway\u2019s width (0.5\u202fm) to each side and find the outer perimeter, using the same \u201cadd\u20112\u202f\u00d7\u202fborder\u201d idea you mastered earlier.\n\n---\n\n### Quick reminder of the \u201cborder\u201d rule  \n\nWhen a border (or fence, walkway, etc.) of width\u202f\\(b\\) is built **outside** a rectangle:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{New length} &= L + 2b \\\\\n\\text{New width}  &= W + 2b \\\\\n\\text{New perimeter}&= 2(L+2b) + 2(W+2b)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nFor the patio, \\(b = 0.5\\)\u202fm, so each dimension grows by \\(2b = 1\\)\u202fm.\n\n---\n\n**Your turn:**  \n\n1. Paste the two lines you wrote for the fence\u2011perimeter equation.  \n2. Show your work (or just the final answer) for part\u202f(a) of the patio problem.  \n\nIf any step feels fuzzy, just point it out and we\u2019ll zoom in together. You\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\ude80",
