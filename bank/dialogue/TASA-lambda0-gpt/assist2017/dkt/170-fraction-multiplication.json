Multiplying by\u202f1 never changes a value, so the product stays the same.\n\n2. **Multiplying fractions**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{a}{b}\\times\\frac{c}{d}= \\frac{a\\cdot c}{b\\cdot d}\n   \\]\n   This follows directly from the definition of a fraction as \u201cparts of a whole\u201d.  \n\n3. **Reducing the final fraction**  \n   A fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) is in lowest terms when the greatest common divisor \\(\\gcd(p,q)=1\\).  \n   Since \\(\\gcd(32,45)=1\\), \\(\\frac{32}{45}\\) is already simplest.\n\nAll of these ideas are tools you can use **anytime** you multiply fractions.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice problem  \n\nNow let\u2019s apply the same ideas to a new pair of fractions that **do** have a common factor you can cancel *before* you multiply.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\frac{18}{24}\\times\\frac{5}{12}}\n\\]\n\n### What to do  \n\n1. **Look for a common factor** between one numerator and the *opposite* denominator.  \n2. **Cross\u2011cancel** that factor (divide both numbers by it).  \n3. Write the two new fractions after the cancellation.  \n4. Multiply the simplified fractions.  \n5. Reduce the final answer if possible.\n\n#### Write your work in this format  \n\n```\nStep 1 \u2013 cancelled factor: ___\nFirst fraction after cancellation: ___ / ___\nSecond fraction after cancellation: ___ / ___\nResult after multiplication (before reduction): ___ / ___\nFinal reduced result: ___ / ___\n```\n\nIf you get stuck at any point, just type **\u201chint\u201d** and I\u2019ll point out a good factor to start with.\n\nGood luck \u2013 you\u2019ve got this! \ud83c\udf1f",
