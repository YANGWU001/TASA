Let\u2019s simplify first \u2013 it makes the division easier.\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Simplify the fraction  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{45}{150}= \\frac{45\\div 15}{150\\div 15}= \\frac{3}{10}\n\\]\n\n*(You could also divide by 5: 45 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f9, 150 \u00f7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f30 \u2192 9/30, which then reduces to 3/10.)*\n\nNow we have the much\u2011smaller fraction \\(\\frac{3}{10}\\).\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn the fraction into a decimal  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{10}=0.3\n\\]\n\nWhy? Because \u201c3 tenths\u201d means 3 parts out of 10, which is exactly 0.3.\n\n> **Quick check:** 0.3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f3 \u2192 correct!\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Convert the decimal to a percent  \n\nMultiply by 100\u202f% (move the decimal two places to the right):\n\n\\[\n0.3 \\times 100\\% = 30\\%\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Answer  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{45\\text{ cookies is }30\\%\\text{ of the 150 cookies.}}\n\\]\n\n**Why 0.25 was off:**  \n\\(\\frac{1}{4}=0.25\\) would correspond to a fraction \\(\\frac{45}{180}\\) (because 45 is one\u2011fourth of 180). Our denominator is 150, not 180, so the correct decimal is 0.3, not 0.25.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f What to remember\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **Simplify** | Reduce the fraction (divide top & bottom by the same number). | Smaller numbers are easier to divide and less error\u2011prone. |\n| **Decimal** | Write the simplified fraction as a decimal. | Gives a clear number you can multiply by 100. |\n| **Percent** | Multiply by 100\u202f% (move the decimal point two places right). | Turns a decimal into the familiar \u201cpercent\u201d format. |\n| **Check** | Multiply the percent (as a decimal) by the whole to see if you get the part. | Confirms the answer (0.30\u202f\u00d7\u202f150\u202f=\u202f45). |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next challenge \u2013 **Find the part when you know the percent**\n\n> **Task\u202f7:** A school sold **200** tickets for a concert. After the event, the organizers reported that **12\u202f%** of the tickets were never used.  \n> How many tickets is that? Write your answer as a whole number (you can round if you get a fraction, but you\u2019ll see it comes out even).\n\n**Hint:** Use the same formula, but solve for the *part* this time:\n\n\\[\n\\text{part} = \\frac{\\text{percent}}{100\\%} \\times \\text{whole}\n\\]\n\nGive it a try, and let me know each step you take.
