I\u2019m not really sure what you\u2019re looking for, but\u2026 maybe I can try to say something about discounts? \n\nSo, like, if you have a $100 price and a 20% discount, I think you\u2019d *add* $20 to get the sale price\u2026 or maybe you *subtract* it? I keep mixing those up. \n\nI guess the idea is that you take the original price and\u2026 multiply it by the discount percentage? Like 100\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.2 = 20, and then\u2026 you either get $20 as the discount amount or $120 as the new price? Sorry, I\u2019m pretty confused. \n\nIf you wanted to find the final price after a discount, I think you should do something like: final price = original price \u2013 (original price\u202f\u00d7\u202fdiscount%).

It\u2019s on sale for a 25\u202f% discount.**  \n> Find **(a)** the discount amount and **(b)** the final price.  \n> Do it **both ways** (Method\u202fA = \u201cbreak\u2011into\u2011pieces\u201d, Method\u202fB = direct decimal multiplication) and write your work in the same table style as the example above.\n\n### \ud83d\udccb Template you can fill in  \n\n```\nMethod A \u2013 break\u2011into\u2011pieces\n---------------------------------\nStep 1: 10\u202f% of $620 = __________\nStep 2: 20\u202f% (2 \u00d7 10\u202f%) = __________\nStep 3: 5\u202f% (half of 10\u202f%) = __________\nStep 4: Add the pieces for 25\u202f% = __________   \u2190 this is the discount amount\nStep 5: Subtract from the original price: $620 \u2013 __________ = __________   \u2190 final price\n```\n\n```\nMethod B \u2013 decimal multiplication\n---------------------------------\n25\u202f% = 0.25\nDiscount = $620 \u00d7 0.25 = __________\nFinal price = $620 \u2013 __________ = __________\n```\n\n### \u2705 What to do next  \n\n1. **Fill in the blanks** above with your calculations.  \n2. If any step feels fuzzy, write a short note (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to get 5\u202f%\u201d) and we\u2019ll clear it up together.  \n\nTake your time, and remember:  \n- **10\u202f%** is just \u201cmove the decimal one place left\u201d (or divide by\u202f10).  \n- **5\u202f%** is half of that.  \n- **20\u202f%** is twice the 10\u202f% amount.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, paste your completed work here and we\u2019ll check it together! \ud83d\ude80",
