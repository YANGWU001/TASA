Write the percent as a fraction** | Put the number over\u202f100 (because \u201cpercent = per\u202f100\u201d). | This turns the percent into a rational number. |\n| **2. Clear any decimal in the numerator** | Multiply\u202fboth\u202ftop\u202fand\u202fbottom\u202fby the same power of\u202f10 until the numerator is an integer. | Fractions look cleaner when the top is a whole number. |\n| **3. Reduce to lowest terms** | Divide numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). | The fraction is simplest when numerator and denominator share no common factor >\u202f1. |\n| **4. Turn the reduced fraction into a decimal** | Do long\u2011division (numerator \u00f7 denominator). Write the digits you get; if a remainder repeats, put a bar over the repeating block. | This shows the exact decimal representation (terminating or repeating). |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 Let\u2019s go through the steps together\n\n### **Step\u202f1 \u2013 Percent \u2192 fraction**\n\n\\[\n58.3\\% = \\frac{58.3}{100}\n\\]\n\n> **Your turn:** Write that fraction down.\n\n---\n\n### **Step\u202f2 \u2013 Clear the decimal**\n\nThe numerator has one digit after the decimal point, so multiply **both** top and bottom by\u202f10:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{58.3}{100}= \\frac{58.3\\times 10}{100\\times 10}= \\frac{583}{1000}\n\\]\n\n> **Your turn:** Confirm that you get \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{583}{1000}\\).  \n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable, you can move on; if not, let me know what part feels fuzzy.\n\n---\n\n### **Step\u202f3 \u2013 Reduce to lowest terms**\n\nWe need the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 583 and\u202f1000.\n\n* Quick way: try the small primes 2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11 \u2026 until you find a divisor that works for **both** numbers.  \n\n* 583 is **odd**, so not divisible by\u202f2.  \n* Sum of digits of 583 =\u202f5\u202f+\u202f8\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f16 \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3, so 583 isn\u2019t divisible by\u202f3.  \n* It does **not** end in 0 or\u202f5, so not divisible by\u202f5.  \n* Try 7: \\(7\\times 83 = 581\\) (close, but not 583).  \n* Try 11: \\(11\\times 53 = 583\\) \u2192 **yes!** 583 = 11\u202f\u00d7\u202f53.  \n\nNow check 1000: it\u2019s divisible by 2,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f8,\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f25,\u202f40,\u202f50,\u202f100,\u202f125,\u202f200,\u202f250,\u202f500,\u202f1000 \u2013 **not** by 11.  \n\nSince 11 is the only factor we found for 583 that also divides 1000, the GCD is **1**.  \nTherefore the fraction is already in lowest terms:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle\\frac{583}{1000}}\n\\]\n\n> **Your turn:** Write the fraction in lowest terms (it should stay \\(\\frac{583}{1000}\\)).  \n\nIf you thought a different number might divide both, tell me what you tried and we\u2019ll check together.\n\n---\n\n### **Step\u202f4 \u2013 Exact decimal (long\u2011division)**  \n\nNow divide 583 by 1000.\n\nBecause the denominator (1000) is a power of 10, the division is actually easy:  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{583",
