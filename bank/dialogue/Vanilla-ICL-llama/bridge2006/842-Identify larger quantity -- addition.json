Here's your first question:\n\n**Question 1:** Imagine you have 15 pencils in your pencil case and your friend gives you 7 more pencils. How many pencils do you have now?\n\n**Visual Aid:** (Draw a simple picture of a pencil case with 15 pencils and a few extra pencils on the side)\n\n**What's your answer?**",

      "content": "**Feedback on the student's answer:**\nYour answer is incorrect. To determine the larger quantity, you need to add the number of pencils you already have (15) to the number of pencils your friend gives you (the unknown number).\n\nLet's analyze the situation: If your friend gives you 6 pencils, you would have a total of 15 + 6 = 21 pencils. However, if your friend gives you 7 pencils, you would have a total of 15 + 7 = 22 pencils. Since 22 is greater than 21, the larger quantity is not 21 pencils.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\nImagine you have 18 pencils in your pencil case and your friend gives you 9 more pencils. How many pencils do you have now?",

To determine the larger quantity, you need to add the number of pencils you already have (15) to the number of pencils your friend gives you. Let's try it together: 15 (your pencils) + ? (your friend's pencils) = ?. To add these numbers, we need to think about how many more pencils your friend gives you. If your friend gives you 5 more pencils, we would add 15 + 5 = 20 pencils. Since your answer was 21, it seems you might have added the numbers incorrectly. Let's try another question to practice adding larger quantities.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nImagine you have 8 crayons in your art box and your sister gives you...\nA) 4 more crayons\nB) 9 more crayons\nC) 12 more crayons\nD) 16 more crayons\n\nWhich option would result in the larger quantity of crayons?",

Also, you previously needed to add the number of crayons you already have to the number of crayons your sister gives you, not find the biggest number of crayons. Let's go back to the original problem. If you have 15 pencils and your friend gives you some more, to find the larger quantity, you need to add the number of pencils you already have to the number of pencils your friend gives you.\n\n**Let's review the correct answer:**\nIf your friend gives you 7 more pencils, you would have 15 + 7 = 22 pencils. In this case, the larger quantity is indeed 22 pencils.\n\n**Next practice question:**\nNow, let's try another problem. You have 18 pencils and your brother gives you 5 more pencils.
