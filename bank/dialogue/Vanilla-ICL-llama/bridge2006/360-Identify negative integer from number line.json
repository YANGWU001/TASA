If you move 3 steps to the left, where will you be standing on the number line?\n\n**A)** -2\n**B)** -7\n**C)** -8\n**D)** -3\n**E)** -1\n\nPlease choose your answer from the options above.",

However, the question asks for the position that is 5 units to the left of 0, which would be -5.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\nLet's try another question. Imagine you are standing on a number line that stretches from -12 to 12. If you are standing at a position that is 9 units to the left of 0, what number would you be standing on?",

On a number line, numbers increase from left to right. This means that as you move from left to right, the numbers get bigger. For example, -3 comes before -2, and -2 comes before -1.\n\nTo find the number that comes before -5 on the number line, we need to move to the left. The numbers that come before -5 are -6, -7, -8, and so on. So, the correct answer is actually -6.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you practice identifying negative integers on a number line. Look at the following number line:\n\n-8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nWhich number comes before -4 on the number line?\n\nA) -3\nB) -6\nC) -7\nD) -8\n\nPlease choose a number from the options above.",
