In this case, we have 4 groups and 6 pencils in each group. So, we multiply 4 x 6. Let's do it together: 4 x 6 = 24. Therefore, the total number of pencils is 24.\n\nNext Practice Question:\nImagine you have 5 groups of 9 crayons in each group. How many crayons do you have in total?",

The question was about 4 groups of 6 pencils, not 5 groups of 9. To find the total number of pencils, we need to multiply the correct numbers: 4 groups \u00d7 6 pencils per group = 24 pencils. The student's incorrect answer was 5 \u00d7 9 = 45, which is not the correct solution to the problem.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you improve your skills.

To find the correct answer, we need to multiply 4 by 6. \n\nLet's try to break it down together: 4 groups of 6 pencils is the same as 4 \u00d7 6. We can start by multiplying 4 and 6.\n\nNext Practice Question:\nThere are 5 boxes of paper, and each box contains 9 sheets of paper. How many sheets of paper are there in total?",
