When you added 10 + 20, the correct answer is 30, but when you added 5 + 7, the correct answer is 12, not 10 + 2. The correct calculation for the ones place is 5 + 7 = 12, and you keep the 2 and add the extra 10 to the tens place, but you didn't add the 2 to the ones place. The correct answer is 42.\n\n**Corrected Answer:**\n- Start with Tommy\u2019s 15 cupcakes.\n- Add Emma\u2019s 27 cupcakes.\n\nI can add the tens and the ones separately:\n\n- Tens: 10 + 20 = 30\n- Ones: 5 + 7 = 12 (keep the 2 and add the extra 10 to the tens place, so the ones place is 2 + 0 = 2, but we add the extra 10 to the tens place, so we get 30 + 1 = 31 + 2 = 42)\n\nNow the total is 42 cupcakes.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n**\"The Fun Run\"**\n\nSarah has 18 pencils in her pencil case.

You mentioned that you'll split each number into tens and ones, which is a great strategy for solving addition problems involving larger quantities. However, you didn't actually apply this strategy to the problem. To complete the task, you need to split the numbers into tens and ones, add the tens and ones separately, and then combine the results.\n\nFor example, if we have 35 + 27, we can break it down as follows:\n\n- 30 + 20 = 50 (tens)\n- 5 + 7 = 12 (ones)\n\nThen, we combine the results: 50 + 12 = 62.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nLet's try another problem together.

Adding the tens together (20 + 10 = 30) and then adding the ones together (5 + 7 = 12), and finally combining the results (30 + 12 = 42) is a great approach.
