      "content": "Feedback on Student's Answer:\nYour answer is **CORRECT**. When you divide 12 cookies among 4 friends, you need to put 3 vertical bars | to separate the cookies into 4 equal groups. So, the correct answer is 3 equal groups of cookies, but I can see you were trying to think about it in terms of the number of groups, which is correct. However, you need to consider the number of vertical bars, which would be 3.\n\nLet's try another question to reinforce this concept.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\nImagine you have 18 crayons that you want to share equally among your 6 classmates. If you put a vertical bar | to divide the crayons, how many equal groups can you make?",

      "content": "**Feedback on Student's Answer:**\nYour answer is **INCORRECT**. Although you stated that there would be 4 equal groups of cookies, you need to identify the number of vertical bars (|) needed to separate the cookies into those groups. In this case, since you have 4 groups, you would need 3 vertical bars:  | | |. This is because each bar divides the cookies into a new group, so you start with one bar, then add two more to get to four groups.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\nImagine you have 18 identical pencils that you want to share equally among your 6 friends. If you put a vertical bar | to divide the pencils into equal groups, how many vertical bars do you need?",

      "content": "**Feedback on Student's Answer:**\nYour answer is **INCORRECT**. Since the student stated they don't know, it's difficult to provide specific feedback on their answer. However, I can guide you through a general explanation. When dividing a certain number of objects into equal groups, we use vertical bars (|) to separate the groups. The number of bars needed is always one less than the number of groups. For example, if we want to divide objects into 4 groups, we need 3 vertical bars (| | |).\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nLet's practice with a new scenario. Imagine you have 9 pencils that you want to divide equally among 5 of your friends. How many vertical bars (|) do you need to separate the pencils into 5 equal groups?",

To identify the number of equal divisions (vertical bar), let's go back to the basics. When we see a set of objects separated by vertical bars, we need to count the number of bars to determine the number of groups. In this case, let's consider a simple example: 3 cookies separated by 2 vertical bars: | |. Can you see how the 2 vertical bars divide the cookies into 3 equal groups?",

When a vertical bar divides a shape or object into equal parts, it means each part is the same size. In this case, the two vertical bars split the cookies into three separate parts, making each part equal. Well done!\n\nTo reinforce your understanding, let's try another question:\n\n**Practice Question:**\nConsider a picture of a pizza with 4 vertical bars. How many equal divisions does it have?\n\nPlease draw a simple diagram or describe your thought process to help me understand your thinking.",

This is the same answer you gave earlier when you were unsure, and you've shown you can do this task correctly when you're confident. To help you build confidence, let's review the concept again. The correct answer can be found by counting the number of vertical bars that divide the shape. In this case, there is only one vertical bar, so there are 2 equal divisions (since the shape would be divided into 2 equal parts).\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nLook at the picture below.
