How many crayons does Tom have in total?\"\n\nThis question is a great starting point because it involves a basic multiplication fact that you've likely learned before, and it's easy to visualize the scenario. To answer this question, you'll need to multiply 3 (the number of boxes) by 8 (the number of crayons in each box).\n\nTake your time, and think about how you can use multiplication to solve this problem.",

To find the total number of crayons, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons in each box.\n\n3 boxes \u00d7 8 crayons/box = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24\n\nSo, Tom actually has **24 crayons** in total. Don't worry, it's okay to make mistakes \u2013 it's all part of the learning process!\n\n**Next practice question:**\nLet's try another one.

You started to think about multiplication, but you got mixed up with a different problem (5 \u00d7 9). For the original problem, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box. Tom has 3 boxes, and each box has 8 crayons. To find the total number of crayons, we multiply 3 (number of boxes) by 8 (number of crayons per box). This is 3 \u00d7 8, not 5 \u00d7 9. The correct calculation is 3 \u00d7 8 = 24. Tom has 24 crayons in total.\n\n**Next practice question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you practice identifying larger quantities through multiplication.

We were trying to figure out how many books the bookcase can hold if Tom has 3 boxes, each containing 8 books. The correct answer would be 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 books. Multiplication helps us find the total number of items when we have a group of groups. In this case, we have 3 groups of 8 books.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nLet's try another example.

In this case, we were trying to figure out how many pencils are in a bookcase that has 5 rows with 6 pencils in each row. Multiplication helps us find the total number of pencils by adding the same number a certain number of times.\n\nLet's try breaking it down: if we have 5 rows with 6 pencils in each row, we can count the pencils in one row and then multiply that by the number of rows.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nImagine you have 3 boxes, and each box contains 8 crayons.

You're on the right track by picturing three little piles with four pencils in each, and you correctly calculated the sum of 4 + 4 + 4 as 12. However, when multiplying, we don't add the numbers together; instead, we multiply the numbers to find the total quantity.\n\nTo multiply, we need to think of each group having four pencils and there being three groups. So, we multiply 4 (pencils in each group) by 3 (number of groups): 4 * 3 = 12.\n\nThe correct answer is 12 pencils. Remember, multiplication is like having groups of a certain quantity, and we multiply the quantity in each group by the number of groups.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nLet's try another one.
