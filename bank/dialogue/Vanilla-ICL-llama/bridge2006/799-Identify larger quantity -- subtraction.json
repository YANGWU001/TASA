      "content": "**Feedback on Student's Answer:**\nYour answer is **incorrect**. To identify the larger quantity in a subtraction problem, we need to compare the two numbers. However, in this case, we don't have a subtraction problem. The prompt says \"Imagine you have 18 pencils,\" which means we are simply describing a situation, not performing a subtraction. To practice \"Identify larger quantity -- subtraction,\" we need to see a subtraction problem.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\nLet's try another question to help you practice \"Identify larger quantity -- subtraction.\" Here it is:\n\nQuestion: Sara has 25 stickers. Her friend gives her 7 more stickers. Then, she gives 12 stickers to her brother. How many stickers does Sara have now?",

Let's go back to the original question we started with: \"Imagine you have 18 pencils in your pencil case. Your friend gives you 15 pencils.\" We need to compare the two numbers to find the larger quantity.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\nLet's try another question to help you practice identifying the larger quantity. Imagine you have 25 marbles in your pocket and your friend has 18 marbles in their pocket. Which number is larger?",

In this case, 32 is greater than 25.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nIdentify the larger quantity in the following subtraction problem:\n\n18 - 7 = ?\n\nWhich number is larger, 18 or 7?\n\nPlease choose the correct answer.",
