The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.\n\nTo find the LCM of 12 and 18, we can list the multiples of each number:\n\nMultiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, ...\nMultiples of 18: 18, 36, 54, 72, 90, 108, ...\n\nAs we can see, 36 is the smallest number that appears in both lists, so the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36. Therefore, 36 is a multiple of both 12 and 18.\n\nLet's try another question to practice this concept.\n\n**Question 2:** \n\nFind the number that is a multiple of both 15 and 20.\n\nA) 30\nB) 40\nC) 50\nD) 60",

The correct approach to finding the LCM is to list the multiples of each number and identify the smallest multiple they have in common. \n\nTo practice this concept, let's take a closer look at the numbers we're working with. If we list the multiples of 5 (the first number) and 8 (the second number), we get:\n\nMultiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, ...\nMultiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, ...\n\nThe first multiple they have in common is 40, but we need to verify if it's the smallest. Let's check the previous multiples of 8: 32 is not a multiple of 5, and 24 is not a multiple of 5 either. However, 40 is indeed the least common multiple of 5 and 8 because it's the smallest multiple they have in common.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nFind the LCM of 6 and 9.

To find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers, we need to list the multiples of each number and find the smallest common multiple.\n\n**Let's Review:**\n\nTo find the LCM of two numbers, we need to find the multiples of each number and identify the smallest number that is common to both lists.
