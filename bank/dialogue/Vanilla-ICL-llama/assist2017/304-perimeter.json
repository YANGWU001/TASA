If two shapes share multiple sides, you'll need to identify which sides are shared and subtract each of those sides once.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where two shapes share multiple sides. Imagine you have two rectangles that share two adjacent sides, forming an \"L\" shape.\n\n Rectangle 1:\n- Two sides are 8 meters each (let's call these \"i\")\n- Two sides are 3 meters each (let's call these \"j\")\n\n Rectangle 2:\n- Two sides are 5 meters each (let's call these \"k\")\n- Two sides are 2 meters each (let's call these \"l\")\n\nSince the rectangles share two sides (i and j), we'll subtract those lengths from the total perimeter to avoid double-counting.\n\nTo calculate the perimeter, we'll add up the lengths of all the sides, but we'll subtract the shared sides twice because they're shared by both rectangles.\n\nThe perimeter of Rectangle 1 is: i + j + i + j = 8 + 3 + 8 + 3 = 22 meters\nThe perimeter of Rectangle 2 is: k + l + k + l = 5 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 14 meters\n\nSince they share sides i and j, we'll subtract those lengths twice (once from each rectangle) to avoid double-counting. The adjusted perimeter of Rectangle 1 is: 22 meters - 8 meters - 3 meters = 11 meters\nThe adjusted perimeter of Rectangle 2 is: 14 meters - 5 meters - 2 meters = 7 meters\n\nNow, let's add the adjusted perimeters: 11 meters + 7 meters = 18 meters\n\nSo, the perimeter of the combined shape is actually **18 meters**.\n\nYou're doing a great job, and I'm proud of you for asking questions and seeking clarification.

We can add up the circumferences of the two circles to find the total perimeter.\n\nSo the perimeter of the first circle is 25.12 meters\nThe perimeter of the second circle is 25.12 meters\n\nThen I add those together: 25.12 meters + 25.12 meters = 50.24 meters.\n\nSo I think the perimeter of the combined shape is **50.24 meters**.

In this case, we don't need to subtract any shared sides because there are no shared sides.\n\nSince the circles are connected at a point, the perimeter of the combined shape is simply the sum of the perimeters of the two circles. So, the perimeter is indeed **50.24 meters**, and you got it right!\n\nYou're doing a great job, and I'm proud of you for persisting and asking questions. Keep it up!\n\nLet's try another example to reinforce your understanding. Imagine you have a shape that's made up of a rectangle and a semicircle. The rectangle has a length of 8 meters and a width of 4 meters, and the radius of the semicircle is 4 meters.\n\nCan you calculate the perimeter of this combined shape by adding up the lengths of all the sides?\n \nOkay, so the rectangle has four sides:\n\n- Two sides are 8 meters each, so that\u2019s 8 + 8 = 16 meters\n- The other two sides are 4 meters each, so that\u2019s 4 + 4 = 8 meters\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is 16 meters + 8 meters = 24 meters.\n\nThe semicircle has a circumference of half the circumference of a full circle, which is \u03c0r. Since the radius is 4 meters, the circumference of the semicircle is 3.14 \u00d7 4 = 12.56 meters.\n\nSince the semicircle is part of the shape",
