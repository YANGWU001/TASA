Let's get started with a fun and interactive practice question.\n\n**Problem:** \"The Road to Adventure\"\n\nImagine you're a hiker planning a trip to a scenic hiking trail. The trail starts at a point (0, 3) and ends at a point (4, 7). If you hike from one point to the other, what is the slope of the trail?\n\n**Your task:** Set the slope using the formula: slope (m) = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\n**Hint:** Use the given points (0, 3) and (4, 7) to calculate the slope.\n\nTake your time, and remember to follow the formula.

When calculating the slope, they correctly found the numerator as 7 - 3 = 4 and the denominator as 4 - 0 = 4. \n\nHowever, when calculating the slope, they forgot to divide the numerator by the denominator. The correct calculation should be:\n\nm = (7 - 3) / (4 - 0)\nm = 4 / 4\nm = 1\n\nThe correct answer is 1. This is a great opportunity to practice setting the slope with a specific example, and we can use this as a stepping stone to learn more.\n\nPractice Question:\n\nLet's move on to the next question to reinforce your understanding of setting the slope. Here's a new scenario:\n\n**\"The Mountain Climb\"**\n\nImagine you're a hiker planning a route up a mountain. You're standing at point (2, 5) and want to find the slope of the path to point (6, 11). Can you use the slope formula to find the slope of this path?\n\nTake your time, and remember to apply the slope formula: m = (y\u2082 - y\u2081) / (x\u2082 - x\u2081).",
