Here's your first practice question:\n\n**Question 1:**\n\nImagine you're planning a road trip from City A to City B, which is 437 kilometers away. If you're driving at an average speed of 67 kilometers per hour, how many hours will it take you to reach City B?\n\n**Remember, you can use your calculator if you need to, but try to solve it mentally first!**\n\nTake your time, think carefully, and see what you get. I'll be here to help you check your answer.",

In this case, we're talking about kilometers (km). So, the complete question is \"437 kilometers.\" The student's answer is \"I don't know,\" which is incorrect.\n\n**Why is the student's answer incorrect?**\nThe student doesn't provide the complete unit (km) to answer the question. To answer correctly, the student needs to add the unit \"kilometers\" to the number 437.\n\n**Next practice question:**\n\n**Question 2:**\nA bookshelf has 219 books on it. If you add 147 more books, how many books are on the bookshelf now?\n\nThis question will help the student practice using numbers with the correct unit (number of books).",

The word \"kilometers\" is a unit used to measure distance, and it's often abbreviated as \"km.\" Think of it like measuring how long a road trip is \u2013 we want to know the distance in kilometers.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Question 2:**\n\nA bookshelf has 982 books on it, and each book has an average of 427 pages. How many pages are there in total on the bookshelf?\n\nThis question involves using a larger number (982) and a two-digit number (427). Let's see if we can work together to find the answer.",
