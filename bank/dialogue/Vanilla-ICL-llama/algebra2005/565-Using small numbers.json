Let's start with a fun and easy question to get you going.\n\n**Question 1:** \n\nImagine you have 5 pencils in a jar. If you take away 2 pencils, how many pencils are left?\n\n**Your task:** Use small numbers to solve this problem. Remember, you can count on your fingers or use a number line to help you.\n\nTake your time, think carefully, and see what answer you come up with. I'll be here to guide you and provide feedback on your response.",

The correct calculation is 5 - 2 = 3. \n\n**Explanation:** When we subtract 2 from 5, we are counting back 2 numbers from 5. So, we start from 5 and count back 2 numbers: 5, 4, 3. Therefore, the correct answer is 3.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nLet's try another question to practice using small numbers.\n\nImagine you have 8 crayons in a box...\nIf you give 3 crayons to your friend, how many crayons will you have left?\n\n(Remember to take your time and think carefully about the answer.
