The given options do not seem to be related to the garden problem, and the student's answer, y = 2x + 3, is a general linear equation. To write an expression for a negative slope, we need more information about the specific relationship between the variables.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTo write an expression for the negative slope, we need to know the relationship between the variables x (the length of the garden) and y (the width of the garden). However, the given options A) y = 2x + 3 do not represent a negative slope.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you learn about writing expressions for negative slopes.\n\n**Question 2:** \"Negative Slope Example\"\n\nA line has a negative slope of -2.

By choosing 3 as the y-intercept, you have successfully written an equation of a line that represents the garden's shape. Well done!\n\nTo reinforce this concept, let's think about what a negative slope means in the context of the garden. A negative slope indicates that the line slopes downward from left to right. This makes sense for the garden problem, as the longer the garden (x-value), the shorter the width (y-value).\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**\"Bike Ride\"**\n\nTommy is riding his bike down a hill that is 8 meters long and 6 meters wide. He starts at the top of the hill and rides down to the bottom. If he travels 2 meters down for every 1 meter he travels horizontally, what is the equation of the line that represents his bike ride?\n\nPlease try to write an expression that represents the situation, and I'll be happy to provide feedback.",

Let's review the concept again. A negative slope in a linear equation indicates that the line slopes downward from left to right. The general form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In your previous correct answer, you correctly identified the slope (m) as -2, which is negative, and chose a value for the y-intercept (b).

The coefficient of x, which is 4 in this case, indicates the slope. Since it's positive, the line will have a positive slope, not a negative one.\n\nTo write an expression for a negative slope, you need to use a negative coefficient for x.

By plugging in the point (2, -3) and getting the correct y-value, you demonstrated a good approach to verify your equation. However, to confirm that this equation indeed represents a negative slope, let's analyze the coefficient of x. In the equation y = mx + b, 'm' represents the slope. In your equation, the coefficient of x is 2, which is positive. However, the equation y = 2x - 7 actually represents a line with a positive slope, not a negative slope.\n\nTo represent a negative slope, the coefficient of x should be negative. So, while your equation is correct for a specific line, it doesn't represent a negative slope. To improve, focus on making the coefficient of x negative.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nFind the equation of the line with a negative slope that passes through the points (3, 2) and (4, 1).",

It's great that you're acknowledging your uncertainty, but as a math problem solver, it's essential to take a step back and think about the concept of a negative slope. A negative slope indicates that the line slopes downward from left to right. To write an expression with a negative slope, you can use the general equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nSince you correctly identified y = 2x - 7 as a correct equation with a negative slope, let's break it down. The coefficient of x (2) is positive, but the slope (m) is negative because it's multiplied by a negative number (-7). Think of it as the line going down 7 units for every 2 units to the right.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nWrite an expression with a negative slope that passes through the point (4, 1) and has a y-intercept of -3.\n\nThis question will help you apply your understanding of negative slopes and y-intercepts to create a specific equation.

It's understandable that you're feeling uncertain, but as we've discussed earlier, math problem-solving involves taking a step back, analyzing the problem, and breaking it down into smaller parts. In this case, we're working on writing expressions with negative slopes. Let's review the concept together.\n\nA negative slope means that as x increases, y decreases. To write an expression with a negative slope, we need to use the slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope.
