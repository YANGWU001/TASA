For every 2 meters he travels up the hill, the height of the hill decreases by 3 meters. Write an expression that represents the relationship between the distance Tom travels up the hill (x) and the height of the hill (y).\n\n**What is the expression in the form of y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept?**\n\n(Note: Remember, the slope is negative if the graph of the line goes down from left to right.)\n\nThink you can tackle this one?",

      "content": "**Feedback on Student's Answer:**\nIncorrect\n\nExplanation: The student correctly identifies that the slope is negative because the height goes down as Tom goes forward. However, the student is missing a crucial part of the expression - the coefficient (the number in front of the variable). When writing an expression for a negative slope, we need to include the change in the vertical direction (height) and the change in the horizontal direction (distance traveled).\n\n**Correct Expression:** For every 2 meters Tom travels up, the height decreases by 3 meters. This can be represented as a negative slope of -3/2.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nTom is riding a skateboard down a hill that drops 4 meters for every 6 meters he travels forward. Write an expression for the slope of the hill.\n\nThis question will help the student understand how to write an expression for a negative slope, focusing on the correct format and including the coefficient.",

However, you are missing the crucial part of writing the expression. To write the expression for a negative slope, you need to include the negative sign and the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run). In this case, the vertical change is the drop in height and the horizontal change is the distance traveled by Tom. Since the hill drops 3 meters for every 2 meters Tom travels, the expression for the negative slope would be -3/2 or -1.5. Remember, the negative sign indicates that the slope is decreasing as Tom moves forward.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nTom is walking up a staircase with 5 steps. For every 2 steps he climbs up, he rises 1 step. What is the expression for the slope of the staircase?\n\nThis question will help you practice writing expressions for negative slopes in a different context.",

      "content": "**Feedback on Student's Answer:**\nCorrect\n\nExplanation: You've made a great connection between the situation and the concept of negative slope. Recognizing that for every 2 steps Tom climbs, he only rises 1 step, you correctly identified that the ratio is 1/2, but since the height goes down as Tom goes forward, you added a minus sign in front. Your expression, **-1/2** (or -0.5), accurately represents the negative slope.\n\nHowever, let's refine your understanding by considering the general formula for slope, which is (change in y) / (change in x). In this case, the change in y (height) is -1 and the change in x (steps) is 2. So, the expression can be written as -1/2, but it's also useful to think about the change in x and y values.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nTom is walking down a hill. For every 3 meters he walks down, his height decreases by 2 meters. Write an expression to represent the slope of this situation.\n\nThis question will help you practice writing expressions for negative slopes in different contexts.",

      "content": "**Feedback on Student's Answer:**\n\nIncorrect\n\nExplanation: You've shown a good effort in understanding the concept of negative slope, but this time, you didn't provide a specific expression to represent it. A negative slope can be represented as a fraction or a ratio with a negative sign. For example, if we consider the height Tom goes up as the vertical distance (y) and the forward distance as the horizontal distance (x), the ratio of vertical to horizontal would be y/x = 1/2. Since the slope is negative, we would express it as -1/2.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nConsider a situation where a skateboarder is moving downhill on a ramp.

To write an expression for a negative slope, you need to consider the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run), but with a negative sign. Since the slope is negative, you should indicate that the rise is greater than the run. For example, if the slope is -3/2, it means for every 2 steps in the horizontal direction, the vertical direction decreases by 3 units.

We've discussed this topic before, and I'm confident that with a little practice, you'll get it. A negative slope is a key concept in graphing lines, and it's essential to understand how to represent it mathematically.\n\nLet's review the concept. A negative slope is a ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run), but with a negative sign. This indicates that the line slopes downward from left to right.\n\n**Example:** If a line has a slope of -3/2, what is the expression for the slope?\n\nTo write the expression for a negative slope, you need to remember that the ratio of rise to run is negative. In this case, the rise is -3 and the run is 2, so the expression for the slope is -3/2.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nWrite an expression for a line with a slope of -5/4.",
