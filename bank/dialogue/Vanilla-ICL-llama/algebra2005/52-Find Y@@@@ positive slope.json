The height of the ramp is given by the equation y = 2x + 5, where x is the distance from the base of the ramp (in feet) and y is the height of the ramp (in feet). If the distance from the base of the ramp is 3 feet, what is the height of the ramp?\n\n**What you need to find:** The value of y when x = 3.\n\n**Think you can do it?**\n\n(Note: After this question, we'll review the answer together and I'll provide feedback on your work.)",

So that would be\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f6, and then maybe you add the 5\u2026 I think the height comes out to about\u202f9\u202ffeet.",

      "content": "**Feedback on the Student's Answer:**\n\nYour answer is partially correct. You correctly plugged in x = 3 into the equation y = 2x + 5. However, you missed the fact that the question asked for the positive slope, which is not directly related to finding the height of the ramp. The positive slope refers to the steepness of the ramp, which can be found by evaluating the coefficient of x in the equation. In this case, the coefficient of x is 2, which is a positive number, indicating that the slope is positive.\n\nTo find the height of the ramp when x = 3, you correctly calculated 2 \u00d7 3 + 5 = 9 feet. However, this is not the slope. The slope is the rate of change of the height with respect to x, and it's represented by the coefficient of x, which is 2.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to practice finding the positive slope. Here it is:\n\nQuestion: Find the positive slope of the line represented by the equation y = 3x - 2.\n\nIn this question, we're looking for the positive slope, which is the coefficient of x in the equation. Can you find the positive slope?",

However, you incorrectly stated that the positive slope would be 2. The correct slope is 3, which is indeed a positive number. The negative sign in the equation y = 3x - 2 does not affect the value of the slope, it only affects the direction of the line. So, the positive slope of the equation y = 3x - 2 is 3.\n\n**Practice Question to Help Them Learn:**\n\nLet's try another question. \n\nFind the positive slope of the equation y = 5x + 1.\n\nThis question will help you practice identifying the positive slope in a simple linear equation.

The slope of the equation is indeed the number in front of the x, which is 3. However, the question asked for the positive slope, and the student incorrectly stated that the positive slope is 1.\n\nA positive slope means that as x increases, y also increases. In this case, as x increases, y increases by 3, which is the slope. So, the correct answer is 3, not 1.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTo find the positive slope, let's look at the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope. In this case, m is 3. This means that for every 1 unit increase in x, y increases by 3 units. Therefore, the positive slope is 3.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nFind the positive slope of the equation y = 4x + 1.\n\nTo answer this question, simply identify the number in front of the x in the equation, which is 4.

In this case, the coefficient is 3, not the number after the minus sign (-2).

The slope is the coefficient of the x term, regardless of whether it's a plus or minus sign.\n\n**What to focus on:** Let's review the concept of slope again. The slope of a linear equation is the ratio of the change in y to the change in x. It's represented by the coefficient of the x term in the equation. To find the slope, we need to identify the coefficient of the x term and ignore the constant term.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nFind the positive slope of the equation y = 2x + 4.\n\nThis question will help the student practice identifying the slope in a linear equation with a positive coefficient.",
