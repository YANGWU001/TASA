However, to improve your skills in solving linear inequalities, it's essential to take a step further and try to understand the concept.

This can be done by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing both sides of the inequality by the same value.\n\nLet's try a simple example: 2x > 6.

In this case, we need to get the variable 't' by itself.\n\nTo do this, we would need to perform the inverse operation of the one that's currently being performed on 't'. Since we added 2 to both sides, we need to undo that step by subtracting 2 from both sides.
