Here's your first practice question:\n\n**Time Challenge 1: \"The Time Traveler's Adventure\"**\n\nImagine you're on a time-traveling adventure with a friend. You both arrive at a theme park at 9:45 AM. You decide to ride the rollercoaster, which takes 2 hours and 15 minutes to complete. What time will you arrive back at the entrance of the theme park after riding the rollercoaster?\n\nA) 11:45 AM\nB) 11:00 AM\nC) 12:00 PM\nD) 12:15 PM\n\nTake your time, think carefully, and choose the correct answer!",

Let's break it down:\n\nThe rollercoaster takes 30 minutes to complete, and the student starts it at 10:00 AM. To find the finish time, we need to add 30 minutes to 10:00 AM. \n\n10:00 AM + 30 minutes = 10:30 AM\n\nSo, the correct answer is A) 10:30 AM.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Time Challenge 2: \"The Time Puzzle\"**\n\nImagine you're at a music concert that starts at 7:45 PM and lasts for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

To find the finishing time, we need to add 30 minutes to 8:00 PM. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we simply need to add 1 hour to 8:00 PM to get the correct time.

The student previously mentioned adding 2 hours to the bus's departure time, which is not the correct method for solving this problem. The correct approach would be to add the travel time to the departure time. Since we don't have the exact departure and arrival times of the bus, let's assume the bus leaves at 2:00 PM and takes 4 hours to reach its destination. To find the arrival time, we add 4 hours to 2:00 PM, which equals 6:00 PM, not 6:45 PM.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's practice with a new question to help you understand how to calculate arrival times.

The correct method is to subtract the duration of the movie from the bus's arrival time. Since the bus arrives at 4:00 PM and the movie is 2 hours long, we need to subtract 2 hours from 4:00 PM to find the movie's start time, which would be 2:00 PM. Then, we need to add the length of the movie to the start time to find the finish time, which would be 2:00 PM + 2 hours = 4:00 PM. However, this is the time the bus arrives, and the question asks for the movie's finish time. To find the movie's finish time, we need to add the length of the movie to the bus's arrival time. Since the bus arrives at 4:00 PM, we add 2 hours to 4:00 PM, which is 6:00 PM.",
