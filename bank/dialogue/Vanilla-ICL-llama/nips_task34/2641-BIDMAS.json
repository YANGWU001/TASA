If each pack has 8 pencils, how many pencils does Emily have in total?\n\n**Use BIDMAS to help you solve it!**\n\nRemember, BIDMAS is an acronym that helps us remember the order of operations:\n\n1. **B** - Brackets (or parentheses)\n2. **I** - Indices (or exponents)\n3. **D** - Division\n4. **M** - Multiplication\n5. **A** - Addition\n6. **S** - Subtraction\n\nTake your time, think carefully, and use BIDMAS to find the answer.",

      "content": "Feedback:\nI'd say that's a good effort, but unfortunately, it's incorrect. You didn't attempt to solve the problem, which is okay. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the order of operations, which is BIDMAS. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices (or Exponents), Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.\n\nLet's apply BIDMAS to the problem:\n\n1. There are 12 boxes, and each box contains 5 packs of pencils. So, we multiply 12 boxes by 5 packs to get the total number of packs: 12 \u00d7 5 = 60 packs.\n2. Each pack has 8 pencils, so we multiply the total number of packs by 8 pencils: 60 \u00d7 8 = 480 pencils.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 480 pencils.\n\nNext Question:\nLet's try another question to practice BIDMAS. Here it is:\n\n**Question 2:**\nA bookshelf has 15 shelves, and each shelf can hold 3 books. If each book weighs 2 kilograms, what is the total weight of all the books on the bookshelf?\n\nTake your time, and remember to apply BIDMAS.",

      "content": "Feedback:\nYour answer, \"I don't know,\" is correct in the sense that you didn't attempt to solve the problem. However, let's break down the problem and solve it together to understand where you went wrong. The correct solution involves using the order of operations, which is what BIDMAS stands for: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.\n\nLet's start with the given information: Emily has 12 boxes of pencils, and each box contains 5 packs of pencils. If each pack has 8 pencils, how many pencils does Emily have in total?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of packs per box and then multiply that result by the number of pencils per pack.\n\n1. Multiply the number of boxes by the number of packs per box: 12 boxes * 5 packs/box = 60 packs\n2. Multiply the result by the number of pencils per pack: 60 packs * 8 pencils/pack = 480 pencils\n\nSo, Emily has 480 pencils in total.\n\nNow, let's practice another question to help you reinforce your understanding of BIDMAS.\n\n**Question 2:**\nA bookshelf has 15 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If 3 shelves are already filled with 4 books each, how many more books can be placed on the bookshelf?\n\nThis question requires you to use the order of operations, so take your time and think about the steps involved.",

This is an improvement from our previous attempts, but we still need to work on applying the BIDMAS rules to solve mathematical expressions. Let's break down the problem and solve it together.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow the BIDMAS rules, which stand for Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. Let's take it step by step.\n\nB - Brackets: Look for any numbers or expressions inside brackets and solve them first.\nI - Indices: Look for any exponents or roots and solve them next.\nD - Division: Look for any division operations and solve them next.\nM - Multiplication: Look for any multiplication operations and solve them next.\nA - Addition: Look for any addition operations and solve them next.\nS - Subtraction: Look for any subtraction operations and solve them last.\n\nPractice Question:\nSolve the expression: 12 \u00f7 4 + 2 \u00d7 3 - 8\n\nWhat is your answer?",

The expression \"3 \u00d7 2 + 1\" requires us to follow the order of operations, which is BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication and Addition/Subtraction).\n\nIn this case, we need to follow the multiplication first, then the addition. So, 3 \u00d7 2 is 6, and 6 + 1 is 7. The correct answer is 7.\n\nTo improve, let's practice more examples together. Remember, BIDMAS is a crucial skill to master in math, and with practice, you'll become more confident.\n\nNext Practice Question:\nSolve the expression: 18 \u00f7 3 + 2",

      "content": "Feedback:\nYour answer, \"I don't know,\" is a good start, but we've worked on this before. Let's break it down. Since there are no brackets, indices, or division in this expression, we move to the next step, which is multiplication. The correct order of operations would be 3 \u00d7 2 first, and then 1 would be added to the result. So, 3 \u00d7 2 = 6, and then 6 + 1 = 7. Therefore, your answer should be 7, not 5.\n\nNext Practice Question:\nWhat is the result of the expression 12 - 4 + 3?",

So, the correct answer is 11.\n\nExplanation: The student showed some effort in attempting to solve the problem, but didn't apply the correct order of operations. In this case, we need to follow the order of subtraction before addition, which is a key concept in BIDMAS.\n\nNext Practice Question:\nLet's try another expression: 18 \u00f7 3 + 2.
