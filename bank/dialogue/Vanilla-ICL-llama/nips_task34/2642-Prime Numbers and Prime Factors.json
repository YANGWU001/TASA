She's planning a hike and needs to know if a certain path is safe to take. The path is marked with a sign that says \" Danger: 36 meters ahead.\" Ava wants to know if the path is safe to cross, but she's not sure if the number 36 is a prime number or not.\n\n**Your Task:**\n\nDetermine if the number 36 is a Prime Number or a Composite Number. If it's a Composite Number, find its Prime Factors.\n\n**Hint:** A Prime Number is a whole number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors: 1 and itself. A Composite Number is a whole number greater than 1 that has more than two factors.\n\nTake your time, think carefully, and see if you can solve this challenge!\n\n**What's your answer?**",

Since you didn't provide an answer, I'll guide you through the process.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand what Prime Numbers and Prime Factors are. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 5 is a prime number because it can only be divided evenly by 1 and 5.\n\nA prime factor is a prime number that can be multiplied together to get another number. Let's use the example of the number 10. The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5 because 2 * 5 = 10.\n\nNow, let's move on to the problem. Unfortunately, it seems like there's no problem statement. Let me provide you with a new question to help you practice Prime Numbers and Prime Factors.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n**Prime Factorization**\n\nWhat are the prime factors of 24?\n\nA) 2, 3, 4\nB) 2, 3\nC) 2, 4\nD) 3, 4\n\nChoose the correct answer.",

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime factors of a number are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.\n\nIn this case, the prime factors of the number Ava is exploring are actually 2 and 3, since 2 * 3 = 6. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\nTo find the prime factors of a number, you can start by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2. If it's divisible by 2, then 2 is a prime factor. If not, move on to the next prime number, which is 3. If it's divisible by 3, then 3 is a prime factor. Continue this process until you cannot divide the number any further.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\n**Prime Time Challenge!**\n\nA bookshelf has 12 books on it. If you want to arrange them in rows, and each row must have the same number of books, what is the maximum number of rows you can make if you want each row to have a different number of books? \n\nWhat are the prime factors of the number 12?",
