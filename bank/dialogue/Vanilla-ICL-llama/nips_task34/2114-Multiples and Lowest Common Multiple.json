This is an opportunity for us to break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Breaking down the problem:**\n\nTo find the Multiples of 4 and 6, we need to list the numbers that can be divided by 4 and 6 without leaving a remainder.\n\nMultiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...\nMultiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...\n\nAs we can see, the first number that appears in both lists is 12. This means that 12 is a common multiple of 4 and 6.\n\n**Finding the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM):**\nThe LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. Since 12 is the smallest number that appears in both lists, it is the LCM of 4 and 6.\n\n**Correct Answer:** The Multiples of 4 and 6 are 12, 24, ... and the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of 4 and 6 is 12.\n\n**Next Question:**\nLet's practice with a new question.\n\n**Question 2:** Find the Multiples of 3 and 9, and then determine the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the two numbers.\n\nThis question will help you practice finding multiples and LCM with a different pair of numbers.

This is a great opportunity for us to practice together. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nTo find the multiples of 4 and 6, we need to understand what multiples are. Multiples of a number are the products of that number and any other whole number. For example, the multiples of 4 are: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, ...\n\nNow, let's find the multiples of 4 and 6:\n\nMultiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, ...\nMultiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...\n\nNow that we have the multiples of both numbers, we can see that the smallest number that appears in both lists is 12.

Let's take a step back and review what we've learned so far about multiples and lowest common multiples (LCM).\n\nMultiples are numbers that can be divided by a certain number without leaving a remainder. For example, the multiples of 3 are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and so on.\n\nThe lowest common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest multiple that is common to both numbers. For example, the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12, because 12 is the smallest number that both 4 and 6 can divide into evenly.\n\nLet's practice finding multiples and LCMs together.
