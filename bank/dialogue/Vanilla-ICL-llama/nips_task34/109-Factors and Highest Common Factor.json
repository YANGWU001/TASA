Here's your first practice question:\n\n**Question 1:** What are the factors of the number 12?\n\n**What are factors?**\n\nFactors are the numbers that we can multiply together to get a specific number. Think of them like building blocks that fit together perfectly.\n\nFor example, if we have the number 12, what are the numbers that we can multiply together to get 12?\n\n**Take your time, think carefully, and write down all the factors of 12.**\n\nYou can use a piece of paper to write your answers. I'll wait for your response.",

Let's take a step back and learn about factors together.\n\n**What are Factors?**\n\nFactors are numbers that we can multiply together to get a specific number. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6 because we can multiply these numbers together to get 6: 1*6 = 6, 2*3 = 6.\n\n**Let's try an example:**\n\nWhat are the factors of 12? Take a moment to think about it...\n\n**Your Turn:**\n\nWrite down the factors of 12. Don't worry if you're not sure, we can work through it together.\n\n(Note: I'll be waiting for your response to provide the next step.)",

The factors of 12 are indeed 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. You correctly identified 1, 2, 4, and 12, but forgot 3 and 6.\n\n**Explanation:** Factors are the numbers that can divide a given number evenly without leaving a remainder. To find the factors of 12, let's try dividing 12 by different numbers: 12 \u00f7 1 = 12, 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, 12 \u00f7 3 = 4, 12 \u00f7 4 = 3, 12 \u00f7 6 = 2, and 12 \u00f7 12 = 1. These are the factors of 12.\n\n**Practice Question 2:** \nLet's practice with a new number. What are the factors of the number 18?\n\nThis question will help you reinforce your understanding of factors and build your confidence.",

We've been working on factors and highest common factor (HCF) together, and we've made some progress. You previously mentioned that the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 4, and 12, which is partially correct. However, we also discussed that the factors of 12 are indeed 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

What are the factors of 18?",

The correct factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\n**Explanation:** To find the factors of a number, we need to find all the numbers that can divide the given number without leaving a remainder. In this case, 12 is not a factor of 18 because 18 divided by 12 does not result in a whole number.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you practice finding factors and HCF.

We've been working on factors and highest common factor (HCF) together, and you previously identified some of the factors of 18, which are indeed 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. To improve, let's review the concept together. Factors are the numbers that divide a given number without leaving a remainder. For example, 1 divides any number, and the number itself is also a factor.\n\n**To find the factors of 18, let's break it down:**\n\n- Start with the number 18.\n- Divide 18 by 1: 18 \u00f7 1 = 18 (18 is a factor).\n- Divide 18 by 2: 18 \u00f7 2 = 9 (9 is a factor).\n- Divide 18 by 3: 18 \u00f7 3 = 6 (6 is a factor).\n- Divide 18 by 6: 18 \u00f7 6 = 3 (3 is a factor).\n- Divide 18 by 9: 18 \u00f7 9 = 2 (2 is a factor, but we already found this factor).\n- The remaining factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18.\n\n**Highest Common Factor (HCF) is the largest factor that two or more numbers have in common.**\n\nFor example, the HCF of 12 and 18 is 6, since 6 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18 without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nWhat are the factors of 24? Can you find the highest common factor of 24 and 30?",

Well done!\n\nHowever, I would like to point out that you might want to double-check the definition of factors to ensure you understand it clearly. Factors are the numbers that can divide a given number exactly without leaving a remainder. You got it right this time, but let's make sure you're confident about the definition.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's move on to the next question to help you build your confidence and understanding of factors and HCF.\n\n**Question:** Find the factors of 36 and the highest common factor (HCF) of 36 and 48.\n\nCan you list all the factors of 36 and then find the HCF of 36 and 48?",
