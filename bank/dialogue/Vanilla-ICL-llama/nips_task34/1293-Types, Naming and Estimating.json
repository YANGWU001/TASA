Here's your first practice question:\n\n**Question 1:**\n\nTom has 18 boxes of pencils to pack for his art class. Each box can hold 6 pencils. If Tom wants to pack the pencils into smaller boxes, which can hold 3 pencils each, how many smaller boxes will he need to pack all the pencils?\n\n**Challenge:** Estimate the number of smaller boxes needed before you calculate the exact answer.\n\n**Let's get started!**",

You correctly calculated the total number of pencils (18 big boxes \u00d7 6 pencils each \u2248 108 pencils total) and then divided by 3 to find the number of smaller boxes needed. However, the correct calculation is 108 \u00f7 3 = 36, not 30.\n\nThe correct answer is 36 smaller boxes. Don't worry, it's a small mistake, and we can work on improving your estimation skills.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\nLet's try another question to help you practice Types, Naming, and Estimating.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\nMaria has 240 crayons to store in boxes that hold 8 crayons each. How many boxes will Maria need?\n\nPlease take your time, think about the problem, and estimate the answer.",

This is an area where you need more practice and review. Let's break it down together. To find the number of boxes, we need to divide the total number of crayons (240) by the number of crayons each box can hold (8). This is a simple division problem: 240 \u00f7 8 = 30.

You mentioned that you figured we have 18, but we didn't see that calculation in your previous attempt.

Since you have 30 groups of 8 crayons, you would need 30 boxes, not 4. Remember, to estimate the number of boxes, we need to divide the total number of items by the number of items each box can hold.\n\n**Practice Question:**\nEstimate the number of boxes needed to store 180 crayons if each box can hold 9 crayons.\n\nLet's work through this problem together.",

You stated that each box holds 9 crayons and you were trying to find the number of boxes needed for 180 crayons. \n\nTo find the number of boxes, you can divide the total number of crayons (180) by the number of crayons in each box (9). However, you need to divide 180 by 8, not 9, since we established earlier that each box holds 8 crayons.\n\nLet's recalculate together: 180 \u00f7 8 = 22.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a box, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, you would need **23 boxes**.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nProblem: A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 12 books.

You initially stated that each box holds 9 crayons, but then you switched to bags. Since we didn't discuss bags in our previous conversation, it seems like you might have gotten confused. \n\nTo clarify, we were originally trying to find the number of boxes, not bags, that Maria would need. If we assume each box holds 9 crayons and we have 81 crayons in total, we need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box.\n\n**81 crayons \u00f7 9 crayons per box = 9 boxes**\n\nSo, Maria would indeed need 9 boxes, not bags. However, the question was about boxes, not bags.

Your answer shows improvement from previous attempts, and I'm proud of you for persisting and finding the correct solution.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nMaria is planning a party and wants to put an equal number of candies in each bag.
