The combination is a 3-digit number that has exactly 2 prime factors. What could be the possible combinations?\n\n**Hint:** Prime factors are the building blocks of a number, and they can be multiplied together to get the original number.\n\n**Your Task:** Find a 3-digit number with exactly 2 prime factors. Remember, prime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. \n\n**Example:** The number 6 has two prime factors: 2 and 3, because 2 \u00d7 3 = 6.\n\nTake your time, and think carefully about the possible combinations. When you think you have an answer, let me know and we'll discuss it together!",

To determine if a number is prime, we need to check if it has any other factors besides 1 and itself.\n\nLet's try another example to help you practice.\n\n**Question 2: Prime Time!**\n\nYou find a chest filled with 12 gold coins on the island. How many gold coins are left if you give 2 friends 2 coins each and keep the remaining coins for yourself?\n\nThis question will help you practice identifying prime numbers and factors in a real-life scenario.",

      "content": "**Feedback on the student's answer:**\nIncorrect\n\nExplanation: The question was not about dividing coins but about prime numbers and prime factors. The correct approach would be to determine if the number 12 is prime or not. A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Since 12 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, it is not a prime number.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n**Prime Factor Fun**\n\nYou find a mysterious box with a combination lock that requires a 3-digit combination. The combination is a prime number between 100 and 200. What is the smallest possible combination that could open the box?\n\n**Objective:** Identify a prime number between 100 and 200.\n\n**Hint:** Think about numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves.",

A prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. To confirm, let's check the factors of 101: 101 is divisible by 1 and 101, but not by any other numbers.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nFind the prime factors of the number 216. What are the prime factors of 216?",

So, the correct prime factors of 216 are 2 and 3.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nWhat are the prime factors of 150?\n\nTo find the prime factors of 150, you can start by breaking it down into simpler factors.",

This is because 216 can be broken down into its prime factors: 216 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3, or more simply, 216 = 2^3 \u00d7 3^3.\n\n**Generating the next practice question to help them learn:**\n\nHere's a new question to help you practice finding prime numbers and their factors:\n\n**Question:** Find the prime factors of 120.\n\n**Hint:** Think about breaking down the number into its simplest building blocks, just like we did with 216.",

Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. In your answer, you've listed 2, 4, 5, and 6, but 4 and 6 are not prime numbers. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have only two distinct factors: 1 and themselves. 4 is 2 x 2, and 6 is 2 x 3. So, let's try again to find the prime factors of 120.\n\n**Let's break down 120 into its prime factors:**\n\n120 can be divided by 2 (a prime number), which gives us 60. We can divide 60 by 2 again, which gives us 30. Then, we can divide 30 by 2 again, which gives us 15. 15 can be divided by 3 (another prime number), and 3 x 5 = 15. So, the prime factors of 120 are actually 2, 2, 2, 3, and 5.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nFind the prime factors of 180.",

The correct prime factors of 120 are actually 2, 2, 2, 3, and 5.\n\n**Let's try again:**\n\nTo understand prime factors better, let's try a simple example. What are the prime factors of 18?

The correct prime factors of 18 are actually 2 and 3, as 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, but 6 is a product of the prime factors, not a prime factor itself.

A prime factor is a prime number that can be multiplied together to get the original number. The prime factors of 24 are actually 2, 2, 2, and 3, or more simply, 2^3 \u00d7 3. This is because 24 can be broken down into smaller prime numbers: 24 \u00f7 2 = 12, 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, 6 \u00f7 2 = 3.
