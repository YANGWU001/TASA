Let's take a step toward building confidence with **using difficult numbers** \u2014 those tricky decimals, fractions, or large numbers that can feel overwhelming at first.\n\nHere\u2019s your first practice question, designed to be clear, engaging, and just a little challenging:\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf89 **Practice Question: The Mystery of the Mountain Trail** \ud83c\udf89\n\nA hiker is climbing a mountain that is **1,247 meters** high. She climbs at a steady pace of **3.7 meters per minute**.  \n\n**Question:**  \nHow many minutes will it take her to reach the top?  \n\n*Hint: You might need to divide 1,247 by 3.7. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 just go step by step. Try estimating first (like, about how many minutes if she climbed 3 meters per minute?), then do the actual division.*\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Answer format:** Type your answer as a decimal (like 345.67) or a mixed number if needed.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Why this works for you:*  \nThis uses a \"difficult number\" (1,247 \u00f7 3.7) that isn't a round number \u2014 just like real-life problems! We\u2019re building your confidence with division involving decimals and large numbers.  \n\nAfter you try it, we\u2019ll go over the steps together \u2014 no pressure, just growth!  \n\nReady to give it a go? \ud83d\ude80",

The next step is to *try* \u2014 even if it feels hard \u2014 so you can learn from the process.\n\nInstead of saying \"I don't know,\" try to **estimate** or **guess a reasonable answer**, then check it. For example:  \n\"Let me try 12.5 \u2014 does that make sense?\"  \nor  \n\"I think it's around 40 \u2014 let me see why.\"\n\nThis builds confidence and helps you develop number sense.\n\n---\n\n2) **Next practice question:**  \nSolve:  \n$$  \n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 2.6 + 1.8 \\div 0.6 = ?  \n$$  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Tip: Break it into steps.
