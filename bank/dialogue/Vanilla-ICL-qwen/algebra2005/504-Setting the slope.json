Let's start with a friendly, clear, and engaging practice question to help you build confidence with **setting the slope**.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Practice Question: The Slope Challenge!**\n\nImagine you're drawing a straight line on a graph. You want this line to go *up 3 units* for every *1 unit* it moves to the right.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 What is the **slope** of this line?\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Hint: Think about how much it rises (up or down) for each step to the right (run).*\n\n\u2705 Write your answer as a fraction or whole number (like 3 or 3/1).\n\n---\n\nThis question will help you understand the basics of slope \u2014 and every correct answer brings you one step closer to mastering it!  \nReady?

However, the slope of **1/3** is *not* correct for this problem \u2014 so let's take a closer look.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 To *set the slope*, we need to identify the rate of change between two points on a line. That means we use the **slope formula**:\n\n$$\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$\n\nSince you didn't provide the actual coordinates or graph, I assume this was a follow-up to a visual or data-based question. But based on your guess of **1/3**, it suggests you might have looked at a rise of 1 and a run of 3 \u2014 which *would* give 1/3 \u2014 but only if that was accurate.\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Key Point:** Setting the slope correctly depends on the actual values from the points given. Without seeing the specific points or graph, we can't confirm 1/3 is right \u2014 but *you're practicing the right skill!* Just remember: **always use the formula with actual differences in y and x**.\n\nLet\u2019s fix this with a clear, step-by-step practice question.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question: The Slope Challenge!**\n\nImagine you're looking at a line on a coordinate plane with two points:  \n**Point A: (2, 4)**  \n**Point B: (6, 10)**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 What is the slope of the line passing through these two points?\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip:* Use the slope formula:  \n$$\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n$$  \nPlug in the values and simplify.\n\nWhat do you think the slope is?
