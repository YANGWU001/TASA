Let's start with a simple, friendly, and engaging practice question to help you build confidence in **\"Find X@@@@ Simple\"** \u2014 which means solving basic equations where you need to find the value of **X**.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Practice Question #1: Find X**  \n\nSolve for **X**:  \n**X + 5 = 12**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 What number do you add to 5 to get 12?  \nThink of it like this: If you have 5 apples and you get more until you have 12, how many apples did you get?\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip: To find X, subtract 5 from both sides. That\u2019s the secret trick!*\n\n---\n\n\u2705 Ready? Try it on your own, then check the answer below \u2014 or tell me what you think X is! \ud83d\ude0a  \n(Just type your answer, and I\u2019ll guide you through it step by step!)  \n\nLet\u2019s grow your confidence \u2014 one X at a time! \ud83d\ude80",

      "content": "1) **Feedback on the student's answer:**  \nGreat effort! You're thinking critically \u2014 that's a strong start. However, let's clarify the problem. If the equation was something like:  \n**12 - 5 = X**, then yes, **X = 7**, not 6.  \n\nYou said: *\"I tried subtracting 5 from the 12, and I got 6 as the result.\"*  \nBut 12 - 5 = **7**, not 6. So the math here is slightly off.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Correction:** 12 - 5 = 7 \u2192 So **X = 7**, not 6.  \nYou were close \u2014 just a small arithmetic mistake! Keep practicing and double-check your calculations.\n\n2) **Next practice question:**  \nSolve for X:  \n**8 + 3 = X**  \nWhat is X?  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip: Think of it as \"8 plus what number gives us the total?\"  \nTry it step-by-step \u2014 and don\u2019t rush!

Since we're practicing **\"Find X@@@@ Simple\"**, the goal is to identify the missing value (X) by using basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.  \n\nYour earlier attempt (subtracting 5 from 12 to get 6) shows you're thinking in the right direction \u2014 that\u2019s great! So, if the equation was **12 - 5 = X**, then yes, **X = 6**. That answer is correct. The key is to *identify the operation* and *apply it step by step*.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 So, your answer \"I don't know\" isn't incorrect \u2014 it just means you need a little more practice with the structure of the problem. Let\u2019s build confidence with a simple, clear example.\n\n2) **Next Practice Question:**  \nSolve for X:  \n**8 + 4 = X**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 What number is 8 plus 4?  \n(Think: What do you get when you add 8 and 4 together?)  \n\nThis one is simple, positive, and reinforces the idea of \"finding X\" through basic addition \u2014 just like your earlier subtraction example.

You're trying to reason through the problem, which is a strong first step.

You're using substitution to test values, which is a great strategy. However, your reasoning is incomplete because you only started saying *\"If I plug 5 in for X, the left\u2014\"*, and didn\u2019t finish the check. To verify if X = 5 is correct, you need to **complete the substitution and simplify both sides** of the equation. For example, if the equation were something like:  \n**2X + 3 = 13**,  \nthen plugging in X = 5 gives:  \nLeft side = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \u2192 matches the right side \u2192 correct.  \nBut if the equation were **3X - 2 = 10**, then X = 5 would give 3(5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 \u2260 10 \u2192 incorrect.  \n\ud83d\udc49 So, to know if X = 5 is correct, you **must complete the math** and compare both sides.  \n\u2705 **Keep up the good work \u2014 the key is to finish the substitution and verify!**\n\n2) **Next Practice Question:**  \nSolve for X:  \n**4X - 7 = 13**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Try plugging in X = 5 and see if it works.
