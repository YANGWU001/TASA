However, **\"ounce\"** (especially \"fluid ounce\") is more appropriate for liquid measurements like milk than \"ounce\" as a general unit of weight.  \n\nBut here's the key point:  \n\ud83d\udc49 In **standard kitchen measurements**, milk is **commonly measured in cups or fluid ounces (fl oz)**, not just \"ounce\" \u2014 and the **unit must be clearly labeled**.  \n\nSo, **\"ounce\"** as a standalone unit is **ambiguous** and not the best choice. The correct unit for milk in a recipe is usually **fluid ounce** or **cup**, not just \"ounce\".  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Therefore, **B) Ounce** is **not the best or most accurate answer** in this context.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Lesson:** Always consider the type of ingredient \u2014 solids (like baking soda) use **grams** or **teaspoons**, while liquids (like milk) use **cups**, **fluid ounces**, or **milliliters**.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Next Practice Question: Unit Detective Challenge!** \ud83c\udf1f  \n\nYou're helping a baker in a kitchen and they're making a chocolate cake.  \n\nThey need:  \n- 2 cups of flour  \n- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract  \n- 1/2 cup of milk  \n- 150 grams of chocolate chips  \n\nWhich of the following is the **most appropriate unit** for measuring **milk**?  \n\nA) Gram  \nB) Ounce  \nC) Cup  \nD) Milliliter  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Choose the best answer and explain your choice!  \n\n(Answer: C) Cup \u2014 because milk is a liquid, and in cooking, it\u2019s most commonly measured in cups or fluid ounces. \"Cup\" is a standard and clear unit for volume.)",

Baking powder is a leavening agent that needs to be measured accurately \u2014 and **volume units like teaspoons or tablespoons** are more appropriate than cups for small quantities.\n\nFor example, a typical recipe calls for **1 teaspoon** or **1/2 teaspoon** of baking powder, not a full cup.
