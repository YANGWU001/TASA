Since no values for rise or run were given in the current question, we cannot confirm that \u20136 ft is valid.  \n\nThe correct approach is to **identify rise and run from a given situation**, then compute slope as **rise over run**. Since the student introduced a value (\u20136 ft) without justification or reference to the problem, it's not sufficient.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Correct process:**  \n- Slope = $\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}$  \n- Rise is the vertical change (up/down), run is the horizontal change (left/right).  \n- A negative slope means the line goes down as it moves right.  \n\n\u2705 *Example:* If a line goes down 4 units and right 2 units, slope = $\\frac{-4}{2} = -2$.  \n\nSo, the student needs to **check the given rise and run** before computing slope \u2014 not just assume or guess values.  \n\n---\n\n**2) Next Practice Question:**  \nA line passes through two points: (1, 5) and (4, 1).  \n\nWrite an expression for the slope of this line using \"rise over run,\" and then simplify it.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Hint:*  \n- Find the rise: change in y-values  \n- Find the run: change in x-values  \n- Use slope = $\\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}$  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 What is the simplified slope?  \n\nThis question reinforces using actual coordinates to find rise and run, helping build confidence in writing and simplifying expressions for negative slope.",

However, the example given (4 \u00f7 2 = 2) results in a **positive slope**, not a negative one. To write an expression for a **negative slope**, the rise and run must have opposite signs (e.g., rise = \u20134, run = 2, or rise = 4, run = \u20132). For example, a negative slope expression could be:  \n**\u20134 \u00f7 2** or **4 \u00f7 (\u20132)**.  \nSo, the correct expression must reflect a negative value. The student\u2019s answer shows a misunderstanding of the sign requirement for a negative slope.\n\n\u2705 **Key takeaway:** A negative slope means the rise and run have opposite signs.

A negative slope means the rise over run is negative \u2014 for example, if the line goes down as you move to the right, the change in y is negative and the change in x is positive (or vice versa). To represent a *negative slope*, the expression should result in a negative value. For instance, **(\u22124) \u00f7 2** or **4 \u00f7 (\u22122)** would give a negative slope.
