However, **we don\u2019t have enough information** to determine the exact y-value without knowing the **slope** or the **y-intercept** (or at least one point on the line).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *A line with a positive slope means that as x increases, y increases too* \u2014 so your intuition that y increases with x is correct. But to find a specific y-value (like when x = 5), we need more details \u2014 for example:\n\n- The slope (like 2 or 3)\n- A point the line passes through (like (0, 3) or (2, 4))\n\nWithout that, we can't calculate the exact y-value.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Example**: If the line has slope 2 and passes through (0, 1), then the equation is y = 2x + 1.  \nThen when x = 5, y = 2(5) + 1 = 11 \u2014 not 8.\n\nSo, your answer of 8 is *possible*, but not necessarily correct \u2014 it depends on the specific line.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *A line has a positive slope of 3 and passes through the point (1, 4).

So if you have a point on the line and know the slope, you can use the slope to find another point. But we need more information \u2014 like a point the line passes through or the slope value \u2014 to find a specific y-value.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **So, to find y when x = 5, we need:**  \n- A point on the line (like (x\u2081, y\u2081))  \n- The slope (m) \u2014 positive means it goes up as x increases  \n\nWithout that, we can\u2019t compute a specific y-value.
