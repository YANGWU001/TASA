Let's make this fun and clear \u2014 you're on the right track, and with a little practice, you'll master writing expressions for negative slope!\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Practice Question #1: Negative Slope Adventure!**\n\nImagine you're drawing a line on a graph to represent the path of a toy car that's going *downhill* \u2014 like a slide. Every time you move 2 steps to the right, the car goes 3 steps down.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Question:**  \nWrite an expression for the slope of this line using the rise and run. (Remember: slope = rise \u00f7 run)\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip: Since the car is going *down*, the rise will be negative. The run is positive (moving right).\n\nWhat is the slope of this line?\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Your answer should look like:  \n**slope = ___ \u00f7 ___**  \n(Then simplify if possible!)\n\n---\n\n\u2728 *Hint:* Think of \"down\" as negative, and \"right\" as positive.  \nLet\u2019s go step by step \u2014 you've got this! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nReady to try?

This happens when the rise is negative (or the slope value is negative).  \n\nSo, expressions like **slope = 3 \u00f7 2** (which equals 1.5) are **positive** \u2014 they go up.  \nFor a **negative slope**, you need a **negative number** in the expression \u2014 for example:  \n\ud83d\udd39 **slope = \u20132 \u00f7 1**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **slope = \u20133 \u00f7 4**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **slope = \u20131 \u00f7 2**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 The key is: **a negative sign** in the numerator or denominator (or both) makes the slope negative.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip: Think of it like this:  \n- If you go *up* as you move right \u2192 positive slope  \n- If you go *down* as you move right \u2192 negative slope  \n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**  \nA line passes through points (1, 5) and (3, 1).
