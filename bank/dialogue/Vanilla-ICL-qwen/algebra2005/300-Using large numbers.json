Let's start with a fun and engaging practice question that builds confidence with large numbers \u2014 something relatable and easy to visualize.\n\n---\n\n**\ud83c\udf0d Practice Question: The World's Largest Library**  \n\nThe largest library in the world, the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (in Paris), has about **18 million** books.  \n\nIf you were to read 100 pages per day, how many days would it take to read all the books in the library if each book has exactly 200 pages?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: First, find out how many total pages are in the library. Then divide by how many pages you read each day.*\n\n---\n\nThis question helps you practice:\n- Multiplying large numbers (18 million \u00d7 200)\n- Dividing large numbers (total pages \u00f7 100 pages/day)\n- Real-world context to make large numbers feel meaningful\n\nLet me know your answer, and I\u2019ll walk you through it step by step! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udcda",

That\u2019s actually **10 times too big**.  \n\nSo:  \n8,000,000,000 \u00f7 100 = **80,000,000** (80 million), not 800 million.  \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Therefore, your final answer is **incorrect** \u2014 you made a mistake in the number of zeros.  \n\nBut your reasoning is strong: you correctly recognized that 8 billion is 8,000,000,000 and tried to divide it by 100. You just need to be careful with the place value.  \n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Correct answer: 80,000,000 people per country**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Why?** Dividing 8,000,000,000 by 100 moves the decimal two places left \u2192 80,000,000.  \n\nKeep going \u2014 your thinking is great! Just double-check the number of zeros when dividing large numbers.\n\n---\n\n**2) Next Practice Question:**  \nA city has a population of **5 billion** people.
