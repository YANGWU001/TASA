You're trying to identify the difference between the quantities \u2014 that's exactly what we're practicing.  \n\nHowever, in this specific question, the correct response should be based on a clear comparison using subtraction to find the **larger quantity**. Since you said *\"I think there are 5 more red apples than green apples,\"* this suggests you've made a reasonable estimate \u2014 but we need to verify if that difference is actually accurate based on the given numbers.  \n\n\u26a0\ufe0f **Important note:** Without knowing the actual number of red and green apples in the original problem, we can't confirm whether \"5 more\" is correct.
