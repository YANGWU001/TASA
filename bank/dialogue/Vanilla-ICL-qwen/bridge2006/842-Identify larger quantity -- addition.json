That\u2019s a great observation!  \n\nHowever, let\u2019s clarify the *addition* connection in this context: When we're comparing quantities, we can use addition to find the total in each group. For example, if Group A has 3 stars and Group B has 5 stars, we can add them to compare:  \n- Group A total: 3  \n- Group B total: 5  \nSince 5 > 3, Group B has more.  \n\nSo, while you didn\u2019t explicitly use addition in your answer, your reasoning is sound \u2014 you correctly identified the larger number. Great job!  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip:** In \"Identify larger quantity \u2014 addition,\" you\u2019re not just comparing numbers \u2014 you\u2019re often adding the items in each group to find the total, then comparing the totals.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Next Practice Question:**  \nLook at these two groups of apples:  \n- Group A: 4 apples  \n- Group B: 6 apples  \n\nHow many apples are in each group?

You're noticing the difference between the groups, which is exactly what we want. However, to improve accuracy, let's be more precise. In addition problems like this, we often compare the quantities by counting each group and then adding to confirm which is larger. For example, if Group A has 4 stars and Group B has 3, we can add to check: 4 + 3 = 7, and since 4 > 3, Group A has more.
