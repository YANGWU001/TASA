But let\u2019s walk through it together to help you build confidence!  \n\nWe\u2019re comparing two groups of stars:  \n- Group A: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f (4 stars)  \n- Group B: \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f (6 stars)  \n\nJust count each group:  \n- Group A has 4 stars.  \n- Group B has 6 stars.  \n\nSince 6 is greater than 4, **Group B has the larger quantity**.  \n\n\u2705 So, the correct answer is: **Group B** has more stars.  \n\nYou don\u2019t need to know it instantly \u2014 just keep practicing and counting! That\u2019s how you grow stronger.\n\n---\n\n2) **Next Practice Question:**  \n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Let\u2019s Explore Larger Quantities!** \ud83c\udf1f  \n\nLook at these two groups of apples:  \n\n\ud83c\udf4f Group A: \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e  \n\ud83c\udf4a Group B: \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Which group has more apples?  \n\nType your answer: **Group A or Group B**  \n\n(Just count and compare!) \ud83d\udca1",
