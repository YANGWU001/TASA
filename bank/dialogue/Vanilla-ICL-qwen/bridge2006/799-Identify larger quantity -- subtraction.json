Let's start with a fun and simple practice question to help you build confidence in **Identify Larger Quantity \u2013 Subtraction**.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Practice Question:**  \nLila has 8 red marbles and 5 blue marbles. She wants to know how many *more* red marbles she has than blue marbles.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 How many more red marbles does Lila have than blue marbles?  \n\n(Hint: Subtract the smaller number from the larger one!)\n\n---\n\n\u2705 Tip: When you\u2019re comparing two groups and want to know how much *more* one has, you subtract the smaller number from the larger one!  \n\nLet me know your answer, and I\u2019ll walk you through it step by step! \ud83d\ude0a",

      "content": "\u2705 **Feedback on Student's Answer:**  \nYour answer, *\"I think Lila has 3 more red marbles than blue marbles,\"* is **not correct** \u2014 because the original practice question didn\u2019t provide information about how many blue marbles Lila has.  \n\nTo **identify the larger quantity using subtraction**, we need to know both numbers. For example:  \n- If Lila has 8 red marbles and 5 blue marbles, then:  \n  8 \u2212 5 = 3 \u2192 So, she has **3 more red marbles**.  \n\nBut since the question only said she has 8 red marbles and didn\u2019t say how many blue marbles, we **can\u2019t** determine the difference.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Key Point:** To use subtraction to find the larger quantity, you must know **both numbers**. You subtract the smaller from the larger to find the difference.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 So, your answer is *plausible only if* the number of blue marbles was given \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t. That makes it incomplete or incorrect in this context.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**  \nLila has 9 red marbles and 5 blue marbles.  \n**How many more red marbles does Lila have than blue marbles?**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Use subtraction: 9 \u2212 5 = ?  \nWhat is the difference?  \n\nLet me know your answer, and we\u2019ll go over it step by step! \ud83d\ude0a",

      "content": "\u2705 **Feedback on Student's Answer:**  \nYour answer, *\"I don't know,\"* is **not incorrect** \u2014 it's honest and shows you're thinking carefully. However, since the question was designed to help you practice identifying the larger quantity and using subtraction, we need to make sure you have enough information to solve it.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 In the original question, Lila had 8 red marbles, but the number of blue marbles wasn\u2019t given. Without knowing how many blue marbles she has, we can\u2019t determine how many more red marbles she has \u2014 or use subtraction to find the difference.  \n\nSo, the key idea is:  \n\ud83d\udd39 To **identify the larger quantity using subtraction**, you need **two numbers** \u2014 one for each group.  \n\ud83d\udd39 Then, subtract the smaller from the larger to find the difference.  \n\nFor example:  \nIf Lila has 8 red marbles and 5 blue marbles, then:  \n8 \u2212 5 = 3 \u2192 So, she has **3 more red marbles** than blue ones.  \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Without both numbers, you can\u2019t complete the subtraction. That\u2019s why you need to know *both* quantities.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**  \nLila has 7 red marbles and 4 blue marbles.  \nHow many more red marbles does Lila have than blue marbles?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Solve this by subtracting the smaller number from the larger one.  \n(Answer should be a single number \u2014 like 3, 5, etc.)\n\nLet me know your answer, and I\u2019ll give you feedback! \ud83d\ude0a",

However, in this practice context, we're working on building confidence in identifying larger quantities and using subtraction to find the difference. Since the question provided specific numbers (or a scenario with quantities), the goal is to practice making a clear, accurate comparison. Saying \"I don't know\" may reflect uncertainty, but it also means you're not yet comfortable applying subtraction to compare two groups. That\u2019s a great step toward growth \u2014 next, we\u2019ll practice with a clear, concrete example so you can see how to find the difference between two quantities.\n\n2) **Next Practice Question:**  \nLila has 14 red marbles and 9 blue marbles.

Your reasoning is clear and accurate: you correctly identified that Lila has 4 more red marbles than blue marbles by subtracting 9 from 14 (14 \u2212 9 = 4).

However, in this context, we\u2019re building confidence in solving subtraction problems to identify the larger quantity. When you're confident in your math reasoning (like subtracting 14 \u2212 9 = 4), you can express that clearly.

Since the student didn\u2019t specify which quantities were being compared or provide the actual numbers, the answer lacks sufficient context and reasoning.  \n\nAdditionally, the phrase *\"about six more\"* suggests an approximation, but in subtraction problems meant to identify the **exact larger quantity**, we should use precise numbers and correct operations. Without the full problem setup, we cannot verify that 6 is accurate.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Key takeaway:** To solve \"Identify larger quantity \u2014 subtraction,\" you must:  \n- Identify the two quantities being compared.  \n- Subtract the smaller from the larger.  \n- State the exact difference (not \"about\").  \n- Clearly explain which quantity is larger and by how much.  \n\n2) **Next Practice Question:**  \nLila has 14 blue marbles and 9 red marbles.
