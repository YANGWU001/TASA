Because when you multiply 6 by 2, you get 12:  \n6 \u00d7 2 = 12  \nSo, 12 is a multiple of 6.  \n\nAlso, since 12 is a multiple of 6, and 6 is smaller, we can say:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **The LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 6 and 12 is 12** \u2014 because 12 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Remember: If one number is a multiple of the other, then the **larger number is the LCM**.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**  \nLook at these two numbers: **8** and **16**.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Is 16 a multiple of 8?  \n\u2705 Yes or No?  \n\n(Answer this, and I\u2019ll explain it step-by-step!) \ud83d\udca1",

Because:  \n**8 \u00d7 2 = 16** \u2192 So, 16 **is** a multiple of 8.  \n\nYour confusion might come from mixing up \"multiple\" and \"factor.\"  \n- A **multiple** of 8 includes: 8, 16, 24, 32, ...  \n- A **factor** of 16 includes: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16  \n\nSo, 8 is a **factor** of 16, and 16 is a **multiple** of 8.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Remember:  \n**If one number divides evenly into another, then the larger number is a multiple of the smaller one.**  \n\n\u2714\ufe0f Correct answer: **16 *is* a multiple of 8.**\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**  \nLook at these two numbers: **4** and **16**.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Is **16** a multiple of **4**?  \n(Think: Can you multiply 4 by a whole number to get 16?)  \n\nLet me know your answer \u2014 and we\u2019ll go over it together! \ud83d\ude0a",
