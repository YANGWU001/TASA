Draw a line segment AB of 5 cm using your ruler.  \n2. Using your compass, set it to 6 cm and draw an arc from point B.  \n3. Set the compass to 7 cm and draw another arc from point A.  \n4. Mark the point where the two arcs intersect \u2014 this is point C.  \n5. Use your ruler to draw line segments AC and BC to complete triangle ABC.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip:** The intersection of the arcs gives you the third vertex. This works because the distances match the side lengths \u2014 just like building a real triangle with sticks!\n\n\ud83d\udd0d **Check Your Work:**  \n- Is each side exactly the given length?  \n- Do the three sides form a closed shape?  \n- Is the construction clear and accurate?\n\n\u2705 Once you\u2019ve completed it, try to explain in your own words how you knew where point C should go.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf Why this helps:  \nThis builds foundational skills in using a compass and ruler accurately \u2014 essential for mastering triangle construction.

Using a ruler to draw a line segment of exactly 5 cm is a key skill \u2014 even a small deviation (like 5.5 cm) affects accuracy in triangle construction.  \n- You mentioned setting the compass to 6 cm and 7 cm, but didn\u2019t specify *which arc was drawn from point B* or *from point A*. In a triangle construction with sides AB = 5 cm, BC = 6 cm, and AC = 7 cm, the compass must be set to the correct side lengths *and* used correctly:  \n   - From **B**, draw an arc with radius = **6 cm** (to locate point C).  \n   - From **A**, draw an arc with radius = **7 cm** (to intersect the first arc).  \n- You stopped mid-sentence (\u201cAfter that I set the compass to 7\u2026\u201d), so you likely didn\u2019t complete the full construction.\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Key Takeaway:**  \nIn geometric constructions, **precision in measurement and step-by-step execution** is essential. Every step must be accurate and clearly labeled. Use a ruler for line segments and a compass for arcs \u2014 and *double-check* your compass settings before drawing.\n\n---\n\n**2) Next Practice Question:**\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Practice Question: Construct Triangle ABC**  \nGiven:  \n- Side **AB = 5 cm**  \n- Side **BC = 6 cm**  \n- Side **AC = 7 cm**\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Instructions:**  \n1.

Without knowing all three side lengths, you can\u2019t fully construct the triangle using the \"SSS\" method.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Key Takeaway:**  \nIn triangle construction using **SSS (Side-Side-Side)**, you must:  \n1.

Mark the point where the two arcs intersect \u2014 this is point C.  \n5. Join C to A and C to B to complete triangle ABC.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip: Use a ruler for straight lines and a compass for arcs. Double-check all measurements \u2014 even a small error can prevent the arcs from intersecting!*  \n\nLet me know when you\u2019ve tried it \u2014 I\u2019ll give you feedback and help you fix any small mistakes.
