Let's start with a simple, clear, and engaging BIDMAS practice question to help you build confidence.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **BIDMAS Challenge #1: The Pizza Party!** \ud83c\udf89\n\nImagine you're planning a pizza party for your friends. You have a special recipe that says:\n\n> *\"Cut 4 pizzas into 3 equal slices each, then give 2 slices to each friend. But first, you need to buy 2 extra pizzas just in case. Then, divide the total number of slices by 4 to find out how many slices each person gets at the end.\"*\n\nNow, here's the math expression that represents the situation:\n\n**2 + 4 \u00d7 3 \u00f7 2 \u2212 1**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 What is the correct answer?\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Remember: BIDMAS is your friend!  \nB = Brackets  \nI = Indices  \nD = Division  \nM = Multiplication  \nA = Addition  \nS = Subtraction*\n\n\ud83d\udc49 First, decide what to do first \u2014 follow the order of operations!\n\n\u2705 Don\u2019t forget to explain your steps!

The goal is to *understand* the order of operations, not just get the answer right.  \n\nLet\u2019s break it down simply:  \n**BIDMAS** stands for:  \n- **B**rackets  \n- **I**ndices (powers and roots)  \n- **D**ivision and **M**ultiplication (from left to right)  \n- **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)  \n\nWe always do the operations in this order \u2014 like a rulebook!  \n\nNow, let\u2019s try a simple example together.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **BIDMAS Challenge #2: The Pizza Party!** \ud83c\udf55  \n\nYou\u2019re planning a pizza party and you have:  \n- 4 pizzas  \n- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices  \n- 3 friends come, and each eats 2 slices  \n- You want to know: How many slices are left?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Write the expression to solve this (use numbers and operations).  \n\nThen, we\u2019ll walk through it step by step using BIDMAS.

However, in our BIDMAS journey, we want to build confidence by practicing step-by-step. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 every student starts somewhere, and even \"I don\u2019t know\" is a signal that you're ready to learn. Let\u2019s turn that into a learning moment by walking through a simple, clear BIDMAS question together.  \n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question: The Pizza Party! (Part 2)** \ud83c\udf55  \n\nYou're planning a pizza party and have:  \n- 3 large pizzas  \n- Each pizza has 8 slices  \n- 12 friends come to the party  \n- You want to know how many slices each friend gets if you share all the slices equally  \n\n**Question:**  \nWhat is the total number of pizza slices, and how many slices does each friend get?  \n\nWrite the expression you\u2019d use to calculate how many slices each friend gets.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Remember: Use BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction) to solve it step by step.  \n\nLet\u2019s start with the expression \u2014 what would it look like?  \n\n(Example: Total slices = 3 \u00d7 8 \u2192 each friend gets (3 \u00d7 8) \u00f7 12)  \n\nThis will help you practice multiplication and division in the correct order \u2014 a key part of BIDMAS! \ud83d\ude0a",

However, since we're practicing BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction), the goal is to gradually build the ability to *apply* the order of operations, not just state uncertainty. Saying \"I don't know\" is appropriate when you're unsure, but next time, try to *think through* one step \u2014 for example, \"What\u2019s the first operation I should do?\" \u2014 to begin building the skills.\n\n2) **Next practice question:**  \nEvaluate:  \n**3 + 4 \u00d7 2 \u2013 (5 \u2013 1)**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: Remember BIDMAS \u2014 what comes first?

However, for this specific step in BIDMAS (Brackets), you should calculate the expression inside the brackets:  \n(5 \u2013 2) = 3  \nSo, the correct answer is **3**.  \n\nEven though you're unsure, practicing step-by-step helps build confidence.

However, your final answer is incomplete, and the expression you're working on isn't fully stated.  \n\nTo clarify: If the original expression was something like **(8 \u2013 3) + 4**, then your steps are correct:  \n- First: (8 \u2013 3) = 5  \n- Then: 5 + 4 = 9  \n\n\u2705 So, if that was the full expression, your reasoning is on the right track \u2014 you just need to finish the calculation and state the final answer clearly.  \n\nBut if the expression was different (e.g., 8 \u2013 3 + 4 without parentheses), the order would still be left to right after BIDMAS, and the answer would still be 9.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Key takeaway:** You\u2019re applying BIDMAS correctly by handling parentheses first, and then proceeding with addition.
