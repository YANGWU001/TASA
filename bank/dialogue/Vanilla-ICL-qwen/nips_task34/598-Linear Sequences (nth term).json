Your rule \"add 5\" is a correct description of the pattern and shows strong pattern recognition.  \n\nHowever, in the context of **linear sequences (nth term)**, we usually express the rule in a more formal way:  \n\ud83d\udc49 The **nth term** of a linear sequence is written as:  \n**a\u2099 = a + (n \u2013 1)d**  \nWhere:  \n- *a* = first term  \n- *d* = common difference  \n- *n* = term number  \n\nSo, if the sequence starts at, say, 3 and increases by 5 each time (e.g., 3, 8, 13, 18, ...), then:  \n- a = 3  \n- d = 5  \n- nth term = 3 + (n \u2013 1) \u00d7 5 = 5n \u2013 2  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 So while \"add 5\" is correct for the *pattern*, we can go further and find the **nth term formula** \u2014 which is what we aim to build fluency with.  \n\nKeep up the great work \u2014 you're on the right track! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Practice Question #2: Find the nth term!** \ud83c\udf1f  \nLook at this sequence:  \n**5, 9, 13, 17, 21, ...**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 What is the **nth term** of this sequence?  \n\n*Hint: First, find the common difference.
