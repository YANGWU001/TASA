They understood the method and applied it correctly. The error was in the conclusion, not the process.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Key takeaway**: Always verify the final answer after completing the checks. Since 61 is not divisible by any prime \u2264 \u221a61, **61 IS a prime number**.  \n\n---\n\n**2) Next Practice Question to Help Them Learn:**  \n\n**Is 97 a prime number?**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *To solve:*  \n- Estimate \u221a97 (between 9 and 10, since 9\u00b2 = 81, 10\u00b2 = 100).  \n- List all prime numbers \u2264 9 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7).  \n- Divide 97 by each of these and check if any division results in a whole number.  \n- If none do, then 97 is prime.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip: Try dividing 97 by 2, 3, 5, and 7 \u2014 you\u2019ll find none work. That means 97 is prime!*  \n\nLet me know your answer, and I\u2019ll give you detailed feedback! \ud83d\ude0a",
