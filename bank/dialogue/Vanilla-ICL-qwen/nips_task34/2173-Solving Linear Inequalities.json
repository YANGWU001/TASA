Add 5 to both sides: \\(3x - 5 + 5 < 10$\"  \n\nThis step is **correct in intent** \u2014 you're trying to eliminate the \\(-5\\) on the left side.  \n\u2705 Adding 5 to both sides is the right move.  \n\u2705 The left side becomes \\(3x\\), since \\(-5 + 5 = 0\\).  \n\n\u274c However, your work **is incomplete** \u2014 you didn't finish the inequality.  \nYou wrote:  \n\\(3x - 5 + 5 < 10\\)  \nBut this should simplify to:  \n\\(3x < 10\\)  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 So, your final expression after Step 1 should be:  \n**\\(3x < 10\\)**  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **Key takeaway:**  \nAlways simplify both sides after performing operations. Don\u2019t stop at the step \u2014 continue to solve for \\(x\\).\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Corrected and Completed Steps (for reference):**  \n1.

However, in the context of practice, we expect students to try solving the problem step-by-step, even if they don\u2019t have the final answer immediately. Simply stating \"I don't know\" without showing any attempt or reasoning means the problem was not addressed, and thus the answer is incomplete.  \n\n**What to do next:**  \nInstead of giving up, the student should try to solve the inequality step-by-step \u2014 even if they get stuck. This builds confidence and reinforces the process. Start by identifying the variable, applying inverse operations, and remembering to flip the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcda **Next Practice Question:**  \nSolve the following linear inequality:  \n**3x - 7 < 8**  \n\n**Steps to guide them:**  \n1.
