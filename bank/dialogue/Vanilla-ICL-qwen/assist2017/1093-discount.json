Let\u2019s go over why:  \n\n- 20% of \\$40 = (20 \u00f7 100) \u00d7 40 = 0.20 \u00d7 40 = **\\$8**  \n- So, you save **\\$8**, and the final price is \\$40 \u2212 \\$8 = **\\$32**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Your estimate of \u201cabout \\$6\u201d was close, but a bit low \u2014 it sounds like you were thinking of a smaller percentage or misremembering the calculation.

While it doesn't include a concrete calculation or clear reasoning, the attempt to think through the problem demonstrates growth in confidence and effort. To improve, the student should begin using a simple discount formula:  \n**Discount Amount = Original Price \u00d7 (Discount Rate)**  \nFor example, if an item costs $50 and has a 20% discount, then:  \nDiscount = $50 \u00d7 0.20 = $10.  \n\nEncourage the student to try calculating a specific number rather than just guessing.

The estimate of **$8** as the discount is close, but we need to verify the context. Since the original price and discount percentage were not provided in the previous question, we can't confirm whether $8 is accurate.
