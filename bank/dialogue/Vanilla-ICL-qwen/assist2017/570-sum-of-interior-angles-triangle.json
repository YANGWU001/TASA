Each friend is holding a sign that shows the measure of the angle at their corner.\n\nOne friend says: \"My angle is 50\u00b0!\"  \nAnother says: \"My angle is 60\u00b0!\"  \nThe third one is quiet \u2014 they're thinking hard!\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Question:**  \nWhat is the measure of the third angle in the triangle?  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Remember: The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always 180\u00b0.*\n\nCan you help the third friend find their angle? Let's add up the known angles and find the missing one!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Type your answer here: __________\u00b0\n\n---\n\nThis question gives your student a chance to apply the rule in a friendly, real-world context while building confidence.

If the other two angles are, for example, 60\u00b0 and 50\u00b0, then the third angle would be:  \n180\u00b0 \u2212 60\u00b0 \u2212 50\u00b0 = 70\u00b0.  \nSo, **80\u00b0** could work *if* the other two angles add up to 100\u00b0 \u2014 but we don\u2019t have the full details. Without knowing the other two angles, we can\u2019t confirm 80\u00b0 is correct.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Key takeaway:** To find the third angle, always subtract the sum of the two known angles from 180\u00b0.  \nYou're on the right track \u2014 keep practicing with full angle values!\n\n---\n\n2) **Next Practice Question:**  \n\ud83d\udccc *In a triangle, two angles measure 45\u00b0 and 75\u00b0.
