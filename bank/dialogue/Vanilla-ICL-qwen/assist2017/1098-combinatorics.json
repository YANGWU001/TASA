      "content": "\u2705 **Feedback on Student's Answer:**  \nThe student said *\"I don't know\"* \u2014 this is **not a correct answer** in the context of a practice question, because we're asking them to apply combinatorial reasoning. However, it shows that the student is still uncertain, which is perfectly okay and gives us a chance to support them.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Why this matters:** In combinatorics, we often count the number of ways to choose items from a set \u2014 like pizza toppings \u2014 without regard to order. The key is to understand whether the problem involves combinations (order doesn't matter) or permutations (order does).  \n\nSince the student previously thought there were 7 combinations, they may be confusing the number of toppings with the number of combinations. Let\u2019s clarify:  \n- If there are **3 toppings** (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, onions), the number of possible topping combinations (including the option of no toppings) is **2\u00b3 = 8** \u2014 because each topping can either be included or not.  \n- This includes the empty set (no toppings).  \n\nSo, for a small set of toppings, the total number of combinations is **2\u207f**, where *n* is the number of toppings.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Key takeaway:** Always ask: *Are we choosing subsets?* Then, the number of combinations is **2\u207f** (if order doesn\u2019t matter and we allow empty sets).  \n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question: The T-Shirt Combo Problem** \ud83c\udfaf  \n\nYou\u2019re organizing a group of 5 friends to pick t-shirts from a store that has **3** different styles:  \n- Classic  \n- Graphic  \n- Slim Fit  \n\nEach person can choose **one** style. How many different **combinations of t-shirt styles** can the group choose (if each person picks one style)?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Hint: Think about the choices each person has, and whether the order of selection matters.  \n\n(Answer format: Just give the number \u2014 no explanation needed.)  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *This builds on combinations and introduces a slightly more complex scenario \u2014 but still grounded in basic principles.*  \n\nLet\u2019s see if you can figure it out now! \ud83d\ude0a",

However, since the student previously correctly applied the combination formula $\\binom{5}{2} = 15$ to find the number of two-topping combos, they already demonstrated understanding of the concept.  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nYou\u2019ve shown strong progress by recognizing that combinations (not permutations) are needed when selecting toppings where order doesn\u2019t matter. The formula $\\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$ is perfect for counting unordered selections \u2014 like choosing 2 toppings from 5. In this case, $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$, wait \u2014 correction: actually, $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$, not 15.  \n\nWait \u2014 **this is a critical correction!**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$, not 15.  \nSo the student\u2019s answer of **15** was **incorrect**.  \n\n\u274c **Correction:** The student said they got 15, but $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$. Therefore, the correct number of two-topping combos from 5 toppings is **10**, not 15.  \n\nThus, the student\u2019s **initial answer of 15 was wrong** \u2014 likely due to a calculation or formula error. The correct value is **10**.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Final Feedback:**  \nYour initial answer of 15 was **incorrect**. The correct number of two-topping combos from 5 toppings is $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$. You were on the right track by using combinations, but the arithmetic needs to be double-checked.
