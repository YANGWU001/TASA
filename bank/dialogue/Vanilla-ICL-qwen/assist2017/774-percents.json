Let's start with something simple, fun, and meaningful \u2014 a question that builds confidence and helps you see percents in everyday life.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Practice Question:**\n\n*You're at a store and see a shirt that costs $40. The store is having a sale \u2014 it's 25% off. How much money will you save on the shirt?*\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Tip: Think about what 25% means \u2014 it\u2019s 25 out of 100. So, you\u2019re saving 25 parts of every 100 parts of the original price.\n\nReady to solve it? Let me know your answer, and I\u2019ll walk you through it step by step \u2014 no pressure, just learning! \ud83d\ude0a",

You're thinking about the sale and how it saves money \u2014 that\u2019s a great start. \ud83d\ude0a  \n\nHowever, your answer \u201cI think the sale saves me about $12 on the shirt\u201d is **not yet complete** because it doesn\u2019t show how you arrived at that number or what the original price or percent discount was. To know if $12 is correct, we need more information \u2014 like the original price of the shirt or the percent off.  \n\nFor example, if a shirt was originally $60 and is on sale for 20% off, then:  \n20% of $60 = 0.20 \u00d7 60 = $12 \u2192 so yes, $12 saved!  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 So your answer *might* be correct **if** the problem had those numbers. But since the original problem wasn\u2019t fully shared, we can\u2019t confirm yet.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Key takeaway:** To solve percent problems, you need to:  \n- Know the original amount (original price)  \n- Know the percent being taken (like 20% off)  \n- Then calculate: (percent \u00f7 100) \u00d7 original amount = amount saved  \n\nLet\u2019s practice with a clear, step-by-step example next!\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Next Practice Question:**  \nA pair of jeans originally costs $50. They are on sale for 30% off.  \n**How much money do you save?**  \n*(Show your work: What is 30% of $50?)*  \n\nTry solving this step-by-step \u2014 and I\u2019ll help you check it! \ud83d\ude0a",

It means you're not giving up, which is important when learning percents. However, in this context, we're looking for a clear, reasoned answer based on the problem (which was about a sale saving money).

That\u2019s exactly what good problem-solving looks like: being honest about uncertainty and willing to explore.  \n\nHowever, this answer is not a complete or correct solution because it doesn\u2019t include a numerical value or clear reasoning. To improve, try to **calculate the actual discount** using the percent. For example, if an item is 20% off, you can find the discount by multiplying the original price by 20% (or 0.20).  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Next step:** Practice calculating a simple discount to build confidence.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**  \nA pair of shoes originally costs $60.
