Let's start with a simple, friendly, and engaging practice question to build your confidence with fraction multiplication.\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Fraction Multiplication Practice Question** \ud83c\udf1f\n\n**Question:**  \nLila is baking cookies. She has a recipe that calls for **2/3 of a cup** of sugar. But she wants to make **half** of the recipe. How many cups of sugar does she need now?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: Think about multiplying the fraction 2/3 by 1/2. What happens when you multiply fractions?*\n\n\u2705 Remember: To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators.\n\nReady? Give it a try \u2014 and don\u2019t worry if it takes a few tries! We\u2019ll go step by step together. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\uddc1",

You're on the right track by recognizing that you need to multiply the numerators and denominators.  \n\nYou said: *\"I\u2019d do 2 \u00d7...\"* \u2014 this is correct in spirit! When multiplying fractions, you multiply the **numerators** together and the **denominators** together.  \n\nSo, for **2/3 \u00d7 1/2**:  \n- Multiply the numerators: 2 \u00d7 1 = 2  \n- Multiply the denominators: 3 \u00d7 2 = 6  \n\u2192 This gives you **2/6**  \n\nNow, simplify:  \n2/6 can be reduced by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 \u2192 **1/3**  \n\n\u2705 Final answer: **1/3**\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip:** Always multiply straight across (numerator \u00d7 numerator, denominator \u00d7 denominator), then simplify if possible!\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Next Practice Question** \ud83c\udf1f  \n**Question:** Multiply **3/4 \u00d7 2/5**.  \nWhat is the product?
