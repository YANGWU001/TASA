She gives 20% of them to her friend. How many marbles does she give away?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Think: \"What is 20% of 50?\"  \n\ud83d\udc49 Remember: \"Percent means 'out of 100' \u2014 so 20% = 20 out of 100.\"  \n\nTake your time \u2014 you\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\ude0a  \nWhat do you think the answer is?

You're on the right track. \ud83d\ude0a  \n\nYou said: *\"5 seems like it could be 20% of 50.\"*  \nThat\u2019s **correct**! Let's verify:  \n20% of 50 = (20/100) \u00d7 50 = 0.20 \u00d7 50 = **10**.  \n\nWait \u2014 that means 20% of 50 is **10**, not 5.  \nSo 5 is actually **10% of 50**, since (5/50) = 0.10 = 10%.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 So your answer was **incorrect** in the conclusion, but your reasoning showed good intuition!
