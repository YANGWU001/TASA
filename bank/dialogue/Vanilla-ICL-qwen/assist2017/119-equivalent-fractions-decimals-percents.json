Your choice of **(A) 0** suggests you're thinking about the value, which is a good start.  \n\nHowever, **(A) 0** is not correct for this question (we\u2019ll explain why below). Let\u2019s take a quick moment to clarify:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents are different ways of expressing the same value. For example, **1/2 = 0.5 = 50%**.  \n\nSo, if the question was something like *\"What is 1/2 as a decimal?\"* \u2014 the answer would be **0.5**, not 0.  \nIf it was *\"What is 50% as a fraction?\"* \u2014 the answer would be **1/2**.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 The value **0** only applies if the fraction or percent is zero \u2014 like 0/100 or 0%.  \n\nSo, in this case, since you picked 0, it seems the question likely asked for a **non-zero equivalent** (like 1/2, 25%, or 0.75).  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Next step:** Let\u2019s build your confidence by practicing a simple, clear example together.  \n\n---\n\n**\ud83c\udf89 Next Practice Question:**  \nWhat is **1/2** as a decimal?  \n\nA) 0  \nB) 0.2  \nC) 0.5  \nD) 1  \n\n\u2705 Choose the correct option and explain your reasoning \u2014 even if you're unsure!
