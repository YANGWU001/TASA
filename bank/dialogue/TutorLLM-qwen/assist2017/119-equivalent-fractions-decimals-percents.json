      "content": "Great! Since your student has shown **some difficulty** in understanding equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents \u2014 even though they *eventually* mastered the concept \u2014 we want to build confidence through **clear, step-by-step practice** that focuses on **common pitfalls** and **visual reasoning**.\n\nHere\u2019s a well-designed, **first practice question** tailored to their level:\n\n---\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Practice Question 1: Match the Equivalent Values**  \nMatch each fraction to its equivalent decimal and percent.  \n(Only one answer per box \u2014 choose the correct pair!)\n\n| Fraction | Decimal | Percent |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1/2    |        |        |\n| 3/4    |        |        |\n| 1/4    |        |        |\n| 1/5    |        |        |\n| 2/5    |        |        |\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip for Success**:  \nStart by thinking about common fractions you know (like 1/2 = 50%). Then divide the numerator by the denominator to get the decimal. Multiply the decimal by 100 to get the percent.  \nFor example:  \n\ud83d\udc49 1/2 = 0.5 \u2192 50%  \n\ud83d\udc49 3/4 = 0.75 \u2192 75%\n\n\u2705 **What to do next**:  \nWrite down your answers in the boxes. Then check your work \u2014 and if you're unsure, try drawing a pie chart or number line to visualize the parts.\n\n---\n\nWhy this works for the student:\n- Builds confidence with **familiar, foundational fractions** (1/2, 1/4, 1/5).\n- Avoids complex or obscure fractions.\n- Reinforces the **step-by-step process**: fraction \u2192 decimal \u2192 percent.\n- Offers a visual hook (pie chart/number line) to support understanding.\n- Provides a low-stakes, structured format \u2014 perfect for a student who struggled before.\n\nLet me know when they\u2019ve tried it \u2014 I\u2019ll follow up with feedback or a next-step question! \ud83d\ude0a",
