Since your student has struggled with percents in the past\u2014specifically with 30% accuracy\u2014let\u2019s start with a **simple, concrete, and visual** practice question that builds confidence and reinforces foundational understanding.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Practice Question #1:**\n\n> *Sarah has a bag of 20 marbles. 5 of them are red. What percent of the marbles are red?*\n\n\u2705 **How to approach this:**\n- First, remember: **Percent means \"out of 100\"**.\n- You have 5 red marbles out of 20 total.\n- Think: *What number is 5 out of 20 as a percent?*\n- Try this step-by-step:\n  1. Divide 5 by 20 \u2192 $ \\frac{5}{20} = 0.25 $\n  2. Multiply by 100 \u2192 $ 0.25 \\times 100 = 25\\% $\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip:** Think of it this way:  \nIf 20 marbles = 100%, then 1 marble = 5%, so 5 marbles = $ 5 \\times 5\\% = 25\\% $.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Answer:** 25%\n\n---\n\nAfter they try this, we can go deeper\u2014maybe introduce word problems, increasing/decreasing percents, or real-life examples (like sales or discounts). But this first question focuses on **basic percent conversion from a part to a whole**\u2014a common stumbling block.\n\nLet me know when they\u2019re ready for the next one! \ud83d\ude0a",

Saying *\"I think it might be 20 percent of the pizza\"* shows you're thinking critically and trying to make sense of the problem, which is *exactly* what we want to build.  \n\nLet\u2019s clarify: **Percents are parts of 100**, not just random numbers. So when we say \"20 percent of the pizza,\" that means *20 out of 100 equal parts* of the whole pizza. But we don\u2019t know what the whole pizza is yet \u2014 and that\u2019s where the key comes in.  \n\nYou were close in thinking about *percent of a whole*, which is a big step.

That\u2019s the first step toward understanding.  \n\nYou\u2019ve already shown great progress by trying to reason through the problem \u2014 even if you\u2019re not certain. The next step is to *build confidence* by working through simple, clear examples together.

You're already connecting fractions to percents. Let\u2019s dig into that:  \n- 1 out of 5 is 20% \u2192 so 1/5 = 20%  \n- 2 out of 8 is the same as 1 out of 4 (since 2/8 = 1/4)  \n- 1 out of 4 is **25%**, not 20%  \n\nSo, your intuition about \"feeling like a fifth\" was close \u2014 but 2 out of 8 is actually **25%**, not 20%. That means your answer is *close*, but we can refine it with a little more precision.  \n\n\u2705 You're on the right track:  \n- You're thinking in fractions \u2192 that\u2019s key for percents  \n- You're connecting numbers to real-world meaning (pizza!) \u2192 that\u2019s powerful  \n- You're not afraid to say \"I\u2019m not sure\" \u2192 that\u2019s the best step forward  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Next step: Let\u2019s practice converting *fractions to percents* with a few more examples \u2014 especially ones that are easy to spot, like 1/4, 1/5, 2/8, and 3/6.
