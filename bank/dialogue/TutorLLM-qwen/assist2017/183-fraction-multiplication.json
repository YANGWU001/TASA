Since the student has had mixed experiences with fraction multiplication\u2014some success, but repeated struggles\u2014let\u2019s design a **simple, focused, and low-pressure** practice question that builds confidence and reinforces the core idea.\n\nWe\u2019ll go step-by-step with a clear example that avoids complexity (like mixed numbers or large denominators), so the student can focus on the **key rule**: *multiply numerators and multiply denominators*.\n\n---\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nSimplify:  \n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5}\n$$\n\n\u2705 Step-by-step hints (optional to show, but you can guide the student through):  \n1.

What is the area of the rectangle?  \n\n**Steps to solve:**  \n1. Area of a rectangle = length \u00d7 width  \n2. Multiply the two fractions: $ \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{5} $  \n3. Multiply the numerators and denominators: $ \\frac{3 \u00d7 2}{4 \u00d7 5} = \\frac{6}{20} $  \n4.

You just didn\u2019t get the final answer right. That\u2019s normal. Every student does this when they\u2019re building confidence. And you\u2019re doing it *one step at a time*. That\u2019s exactly how growth happens. \ud83c\udf31  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Takeaway:** You\u2019re not failing \u2014 you\u2019re *learning*. And every time you try, even when you\u2019re unsure, you\u2019re getting closer.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (Personalized & Targeted)\n\nLet\u2019s go back to **fraction multiplication**, but this time with a *real-world context* to help you see why it matters \u2014 and to help you build confidence.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Question:**  \nA recipe calls for **2/3 cup of sugar** and **1/4 cup of milk**. If you want to make half the recipe, how much sugar and milk will you need?  \n\n**Step-by-step, break it down:**  \n1. First, find how much sugar: (2/3) \u00d7 (1/2) = ?  \n2. Then, find how much milk: (1/4) \u00d7 (1/2) = ?  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **What should you do?**  \n- Multiply the numerators  \n- Multiply the denominators  \n- Simplify if needed  \n\nThis is similar to the area problem \u2014 just with ingredients instead of shapes! It\u2019s the same rule: **multiply fractions the same way**.  \n\nAnd remember: You\u2019ve already shown you can do this \u2014 you just need a little more practice to feel confident.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip:* Try writing it out like this:  \n(2 \u00d7 1) / (3 \u00d7 2) = 2/6 = 1/3  \n\nSo:  \nSugar = 1/3 cup  \nMilk = 1/8 cup  \n\nNow, try it yourself \u2014 and don\u2019t worry if it\u2019s not perfect. Just *try*. That\u2019s how we grow. \ud83d\udcaa  \n\n---\n\nLet me know when you\u2019ve tried it \u2014 I\u2019m here to help you every step of the way. \ud83c\udf1f  \nYou\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\ude80",

It\u2019s about being brave enough to say, *\"I don\u2019t know yet,\"* and then *working through it together*. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing here \u2014 not just solving problems, but building your confidence and understanding step by step.  \n\nAnd guess what? You\u2019ve already shown great self-awareness by recognizing where you\u2019re struggling. That\u2019s *so* important. You\u2019re not stuck \u2014 you\u2019re *learning*. And that means we can work through this together, slowly, clearly, and with care.  \n\nLet\u2019s take a breath, take a step, and build your confidence with a *simple, focused* question on **fraction multiplication** \u2014 the very skill you\u2019ve been working on.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question (Personalized):**  \n\n*Sarah has 3/4 of a pizza. She eats 1/2 of that portion. What fraction of the *original* pizza did she eat?*  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: Think of it like this: \u201cWhat is 1/2 of 3/4?\u201d That\u2019s a multiplication problem!*  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Remember: To multiply fractions, you multiply the numerators and then the denominators. No need to find a common denominator \u2014 just multiply straight across.*  \n\n\u2705 Try it out \u2014 and when you\u2019re ready, share your answer or your thinking! We\u2019ll go over it together, gently and clearly. You\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udcaa  \n\nLet me know what you try! \ud83d\ude0a",

What matters most is that you\u2019re not giving up. You're taking a brave step by saying, *\"I don\u2019t know,\"* which means you\u2019re ready to learn \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly where growth starts. \ud83d\udca1  \n\nRemember:  \n- You\u2019ve already shown resilience by trying when you were stuck on area and mean problems.  \n- With fractions, it\u2019s not about knowing everything right away \u2014 it\u2019s about practicing, making mistakes, and learning from them.  \n\nLet\u2019s take it one small step at a time. I\u2019m here to walk you through it \u2014 no pressure, no judgment. Just clear, simple steps. Let\u2019s build your confidence, one fraction at a time. \ud83d\ude80  \n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Next Practice Question (Personalized & Targeted):**  \n\n**Multiply these fractions:**  \n$$  \n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5}  \n$$  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Tip:* To multiply fractions, multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. Then, if possible, simplify the result.  \n\nTry it on your own first \u2014 then we\u2019ll go over it step by step together. \ud83d\udcac  \n\nThis question is designed to build your confidence in fraction multiplication, especially since you\u2019ve struggled with this skill before. It\u2019s simple, with no mixed numbers or large numbers \u2014 just clear, manageable steps. And since you\u2019ve had challenges with area and mean (which both involve multiplication), this will help strengthen your foundational number sense.  \n\nReady when you are! \ud83c\udf1f",
