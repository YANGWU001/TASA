Since you\u2019ve previously struggled with *area problems* and your fraction multiplication accuracy is only 33%, it\u2019s likely that the area questions required you to *multiply fractions* (like finding fractional parts of a shape), and you may be getting stuck on the *multiplication step* itself.\n\nSo, here\u2019s a gentle reminder:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Fraction multiplication is a skill you already know \u2014 it's just a matter of remembering the steps.**  \nTo multiply fractions:  \n\u2705 Multiply the numerators  \n\u2705 Multiply the denominators  \n\u2705 Simplify if possible  \n\nLet\u2019s go back to the basics \u2014 not to make you feel bad, but to build your confidence.
