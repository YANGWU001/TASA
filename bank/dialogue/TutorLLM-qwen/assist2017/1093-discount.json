You're already applying the correct concept of converting percentages to decimals, which is a key step in solving discount problems. \u2705\n\nYou said you *think* the discount might be **$15**, and you started with the right idea: multiply the original price by the decimal form of the percentage.

That means your estimate was close, but a little low \u2014 maybe you were thinking of 20% instead of 25%? Or perhaps you used a different method (like 1/4 of 80, which is $20 \u2014 that\u2019s actually correct!).\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Key takeaway:** When solving discount problems, always:  \n1.
