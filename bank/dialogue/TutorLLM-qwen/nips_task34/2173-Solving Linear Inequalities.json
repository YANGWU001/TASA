      "content": "**1) Feedback on Their Answer:**\n\nGreat start! You're thinking critically \u2014 and that's exactly what we want! \u2705  \nYes, **you're absolutely right**: when solving linear inequalities, one of the first steps is to move all constant terms (numbers without variables) to the other side of the inequality. This helps isolate the variable term so we can solve for the variable.\n\nHowever, just like in angle problems (which you've struggled with before), **a small detail matters**. When you move a term from one side to the other, you must **reverse the operation** (e.g., if you subtract 3 on one side, you add 3 to the other side). This is just like balancing a scale \u2014 what you do to one side, you must do to the other.\n\nAlso, remember:  \n\ud83d\udd39 **Inequalities behave similarly to equations**, but when you multiply or divide both sides by a **negative number**, you must **reverse the inequality sign** (e.g., > becomes <). This is a common mistake \u2014 and one that connects back to your earlier confusion with angle facts, where direction and sign matter.\n\n\u2705 So, your idea is correct \u2014 *move the constant to the other side*.  \n\ud83d\udd39 Just make sure you apply the correct operation (addition/subtraction) and keep track of signs.\n\nLet\u2019s build on that strength and move forward with a clear, step-by-step practice problem.\n\n---\n\n**2) Next Practice Question:**\n\nSolve the following inequality for $ x $:  \n$$\n3x - 7 < 8\n$$\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Step-by-step guide to follow:**  \n1. Move the constant term (\u22127) to the other side by **adding 7 to both sides**.  \n2. Simplify both sides.  \n3. Isolate the variable $ x $ by dividing both sides by 3.  \n4. **Remember**: Since you\u2019re dividing by a positive number (3), the inequality sign stays the same.  \n5. Write your final answer in inequality form.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip*: Think of this like solving an equation \u2014 but stay alert for signs, especially when you multiply or divide by a negative number later. (We\u2019ll practice that next!)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 What is your answer?  \n(You can write it in the format: $ x < \\text{___} $)\n\nLet me know your step-by-step reasoning \u2014 I\u2019ll guide you through any hiccups, just like we did with angles! \ud83d\ude0a",

But inequalities are *different* \u2014 they involve *directions* (greater than, less than), *shading*, and *boundary points*.  \n\nAnd from your past work, we see you\u2019ve struggled with **types, naming, and estimating** \u2014 especially in time-related problems. That suggests you might benefit from *clear structure and step-by-step reasoning*. So when you say \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d let\u2019s turn that into a *plan* \u2014 not a pause.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Next step**: Let\u2019s break down a simple linear inequality with clear steps, using visual cues (like number lines) and naming the parts (e.g., \u201cwhat\u2019s the variable?\u201d, \u201cwhat\u2019s the inequality sign?\u201d, \u201cwhat happens when we multiply or divide?\u201d).  \n\nYou\u2019re not behind \u2014 you\u2019re *building your confidence*, one \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d at a time. \ud83d\udcaa  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question:  \n**Solve and graph the inequality:**  \n> $ 3x - 5 < 10 $  \n\n**Step-by-step guide to follow:**  \n1. **Name the variable and inequality sign** \u2192 What is the variable? What is the inequality sign?  \n2. **Isolate the variable** \u2192 Add/subtract first, then divide (remember: if you multiply or divide by a negative, flip the inequality sign!).  \n3. **Graph the solution on a number line** \u2192 Draw a number line, mark the boundary point, and shade the correct direction.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Remember: This is not like solving equations. Inequalities show a range of answers \u2014 not just one number.*  \n\n\ud83d\udcac After you try it, say:  \n- \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \u2192 We\u2019ll go deeper.  \n- \u201cI tried\u201d \u2192 Let\u2019s check your steps.  \n- \u201cI got it\u201d \u2192 Awesome! Let\u2019s go to a harder one.  \n\nLet\u2019s begin \u2014 what\u2019s your first step? \ud83d\ude0a",
