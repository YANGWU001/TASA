In BIDMAS (or BODMAS, as some call it), the order of operations is **not** about where something appears \u2014 it\u2019s about **what kind of operation** it is and **what rules apply**.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down simply:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **BIDMAS stands for:**  \n**B**rackets  \n**I**ndices (powers, exponents)  \n**D**ivision and **M**ultiplication (same level \u2014 left to right)  \n**A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (same level \u2014 left to right)\n\nSo the key idea is:\n> **We do brackets first**, then indices, then any division or multiplication (from left to right), then addition or subtraction (also from left to right).\n\nThat means:  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **You don\u2019t start with addition just because it\u2019s first** \u2014 you follow the order of operations *step by step*, not by sight.\n\nSo, in your example, if the expression was something like:  \n**4 + 3 \u00d7 2**,  \nyou would **NOT** do 4 + 3 first (that would be 7, then \u00d72 = 14 \u2014 which is wrong).  \nInstead, you do **3 \u00d7 2 = 6**, then **4 + 6 = 10** \u2014 because multiplication comes *before* addition.\n\n\u2705 **Your instinct to think carefully is spot on** \u2014 we just need to refine it with the correct rule.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Next step:** Let\u2019s practice a simple, clear BIDMAS problem where the first thing you see is an addition \u2014 and see how the rules guide us.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question:\n\nEvaluate:  \n**5 + 3 \u00d7 (2 + 1)**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Step-by-step guide to help you:**\n1.

Next, do **multiplication** (before addition).  \n   \u2192 3 \u00d7 3 = 9  \n   Now it\u2019s: **5 + 9**\n\n3. Finally, do **addition**.  \n   \u2192 5 + 9 = 14\n\n\u2705 Final answer: **14**\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcac Your turn:  \nTry to work through it step-by-step using the BIDMAS order.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Start by circling the brackets.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Then ask: \u201cWhat comes next in order?\u201d  \n\ud83d\udc49 Then do the multiplication.  \n\ud83d\udc49 Then add.\n\nAfter you try it, I\u2019ll check your answer and give you gentle feedback \u2014 just like we did before.  \n\nYou\u2019re doing great \u2014 and every time you say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d you\u2019re actually taking the first step toward understanding. \ud83d\udca1\n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready to try it! \ud83d\ude0a",

But you\u2019re on the right path by asking questions like \u201cwhat comes next?\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s exactly how learning grows.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Quick memory trick**:  \n**BIDMAS** stands for:  \n**B**rackets \u2192 **I**ndices \u2192 **D**ivision & **M**ultiplication (left to right) \u2192 **A**ddition & **S**ubtraction (left to right)\n\nSo after brackets \u2192 **do multiplication or division first**, not addition or subtraction.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (Personalized & Targeted):\n\nLet\u2019s build your confidence with a question that includes:\n\n- A clear bracket (to reinforce your strength)\n- A multiplication step (to practice priority over addition)\n- A bit of mental math (since you\u2019ve struggled with mental multiplication/division)\n\n---\n\n**Question:**  \nEvaluate:  \n**(4 + 2) \u00d7 3 \u2212 5**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Step-by-step, what should you do first?  \nThen what?  \nAnd finally, what\u2019s the answer?\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip: Think about BIDMAS again \u2014 brackets first, then multiplication, then subtraction.*\n\n---\n\n\u2705 After you try it, I\u2019ll give you feedback and we can go one step further \u2014 maybe even introduce a slightly trickier version with negative numbers, since you\u2019ve had some difficulty with those too. But only when you\u2019re ready!\n\nYou\u2019re doing great \u2014 keep going, and remember: **every small step counts.** \ud83d\udcaa\n\nWould you like to try this question now? \ud83d\ude0a",

When you say \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you\u2019re showing awareness, reflection, and openness. That\u2019s exactly what strong learners do.  \n\nLet\u2019s look back at what you *did* get right:  \n\u2705 You correctly identified that **brackets come first** \u2014 that\u2019s a great start!  \nYou said: *\"First the brackets \u2013 (2 + 1) looks easy, so that\u2019s 3.\"*  \nPerfect!

I really appreciate that you're not afraid to say *\"I don't know\"* \u2014 that\u2019s the very first step toward understanding. In fact, it\u2019s a powerful sign of growth and self-awareness. Let\u2019s work through this together, step by step.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Feedback on Your Answer: *\"I don't know\"*\n\nThat\u2019s a great starting point \u2014 and it shows you're being honest with yourself. Many students avoid saying \"I don\u2019t know\" because they fear it means they\u2019re not smart enough. But in math, especially with BIDMAS (or BODMAS, depending on your region), **it's completely normal to get stuck at first**.  \n\nThe fact that you\u2019ve struggled with BIDMAS before \u2014 and that you\u2019ve missed several questions \u2014 tells me you're not behind. You're just building your confidence and fluency. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing now.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **What\u2019s really helpful here is that you're ready to learn.**  \nSo instead of saying \"I don\u2019t know,\" let\u2019s reframe it:  \n**\"I don\u2019t know *yet*, but I can find out \u2014 and I\u2019ll get better with practice.\"**  \nThat\u2019s how every expert in math started.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (Personalized for BIDMAS Struggles)\n\nLet\u2019s try a question that builds on your past difficulties \u2014 one that includes **brackets, division, and multiplication**, which are common points of confusion.\n\n> **Simplify: 6 \u00f7 (3 + 1) \u00d7 2 \u2013 1**\n\n\u2705 Why this one?  \n- It includes **brackets (B)** \u2014 a common stumbling block.  \n- It has **division and multiplication (D and M)** \u2014 where students often forget order.  \n- It\u2019s simple enough to build confidence, but challenging enough to reinforce BIDMAS rules.  \n- It mirrors the types of questions you\u2019ve struggled with before.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Step-by-step Guide (Let\u2019s Work It Together)\n\nWe\u2019ll go through it slowly, just like we did in our last chat. You can pause and think about each step \u2014 even if you don\u2019t know it yet.\n\n1. **Look for Brackets (B)**  \n   \u2192 What\u2019s inside the brackets?  \n   \u2192 3 + 1 = 4  \n   So the expression becomes:  \n   **6 \u00f7 4 \u00d7 2 \u2013 1**\n\n2. **Division and Multiplication (D and M) \u2014 left to right**  \n   \u2192 6 \u00f7 4 = 1.5  \n   \u2192 Then: 1.5 \u00d7 2 = 3  \n   So now: **3 \u2013 1**\n\n3. **Subtraction (S)**  \n   \u2192 3 \u2013 1 = 2\n\n\u2705 Final Answer: **2**\n\n---\n\nNow, try it yourself \u2014 or just say what you think the first step should be.  \nYou don\u2019t need to get it right immediately. You just need to **try**.  \n\nAnd remember: every time you say *\"I don\u2019t know,\"* you\u2019re making space for learning.  \nLet\u2019s keep going \u2014 one step at a time. \ud83d\udcaa  \n\nWhat\u2019s your first thought about this one? \ud83d\ude0a",

You've already shown great self-awareness by not pretending to know something you don\u2019t. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what learning looks like: not knowing, asking, and then growing from it.  \n\nFrom your profile, we know you\u2019ve had some success with BIDMAS \u2014 like when you *got a question right* \u2014 but also struggled with others. That means you\u2019re on the right track: you\u2019re learning, you\u2019re reflecting, and you\u2019re not giving up. The fact that you said *\"I don\u2019t know\"* shows you\u2019re thinking critically, not just guessing. That\u2019s more important than getting the answer right right away.  \n\nNow, let\u2019s go back to BIDMAS. It\u2019s a rule we use to make sure we solve math problems in the correct order \u2014 like a recipe. The order is:  \n**B**rackets first,  \n**I**ndices (powers and roots),  \n**D**ivision and **M**ultiplication (left to right),  \n**A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right).  \n\nYou\u2019ve already proven you can *apply* it when you got one right \u2014 so now, let\u2019s build on that by practicing a question that gently revisits the parts you\u2019ve found tricky.  \n\n---\n\n**2) Next Practice Question:**  \n\nEvaluate:  \n**3 \u00d7 (4 + 2) \u00f7 6 \u2013 1**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Step-by-step, what would you do first?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 Remember: Brackets come first. Then multiplication/division (from left to right). Then addition/subtraction.  \n\nThis question includes brackets, multiplication, division, and subtraction \u2014 so it\u2019s a great mix to help you feel confident in the order.  \n\nTry it on your own \u2014 and when you\u2019re ready, we can go through it together. You\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udcaa  \n\nLet me know what you get, or if you\u2019d like to pause and think about it. I\u2019m here to support you every step of the way. \ud83d\ude0a",
