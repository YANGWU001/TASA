No \u2192 it's prime).  \n\n\u2705 Next step: After answering, we\u2019ll go over the reasoning together \u2014 especially why 17 is prime and why the others aren\u2019t.

That\u2019s a big step toward growth.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify what you\u2019re missing:\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **A number is prime if it has exactly TWO factors: 1 and itself.**  \nFor example:  \n- 2 \u2192 factors: 1, 2 \u2192 \u2705 prime  \n- 3 \u2192 factors: 1, 3 \u2192 \u2705 prime  \n- 4 \u2192 factors: 1, 2, 4 \u2192 \u274c not prime (has more than 2 factors)\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **10 \u2192 factors: 1, 2, 5, 10 \u2192 4 factors \u2192 NOT prime**  \n\ud83d\udd39 **15 \u2192 factors: 1, 3, 5, 15 \u2192 4 factors \u2192 NOT prime**\n\nSo neither 10 nor 15 is prime.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19...** have only two factors.\n\nYou said: *\"I feel like 12 only divides by a few numbers\u2026 maybe that makes it prime?\"*  \nThat\u2019s a **common misconception** \u2014 the number of factors doesn\u2019t tell us if it\u2019s prime. What matters is whether it has **exactly two**.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Key takeaway**:  \n> Just because a number has a few factors doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s prime.  \n> A prime number has **only two** factors: 1 and itself.  \n> If it has *any other* factor (like 2, 3, 5), it\u2019s **not prime**.\n\nYou\u2019re on the right path by listing factors \u2014 keep doing that! But now, double-check:  \n\u2705 Does the number have only two factors?  \n\u2705 Is 1 the only factor besides itself?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So, **10 is NOT prime**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **15 is NOT prime**.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **12 \u2192 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \u2192 6 factors \u2192 NOT prime**.\n\nSo, if the choices include 17, for example:  \n- 17 \u2192 factors: 1, 17 \u2192 \u2705 **prime** \u2714\ufe0f\n\n\u2705 You're getting closer \u2014 just need to refine the rule:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Prime = exactly two factors (1 and itself)**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (Personalized for Your Needs)\n\nLet\u2019s build confidence by focusing on **identifying primes** and **checking factors clearly** \u2014 exactly where you've struggled.\n\n---\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Practice Question:**  \nWhich of the following numbers is **prime**?\n\nA) 12  \nB) 15  \nC) 17  \nD) 20  \n\n**\u2705 Step-by-step Instructions (Do this with me):**\n\n1. **Look at each number and list ALL of its factors** (numbers that divide it evenly).  \n2.

Circle the one that is prime.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip**: Start with the smallest numbers.  \n- 12 \u2192 divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \u2192 \u274c  \n- 15 \u2192 divisible by 1, 3, 5, 15 \u2192 \u274c  \n- 17 \u2192 divisible by 1, 17 \u2192 \u2705  \n- 20 \u2192 divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 \u2192 \u274c\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So, the **only prime** is **C) 17**\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcac After you try it, I\u2019ll give you a quick check and help you reflect:  \n- Did you list all the factors correctly?  \n- Did you remember the rule: *only two factors = prime*?  \n- What made you think it was",

But let's clarify something important:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 A **prime number** is a number that has **exactly two distinct positive divisors**: 1 and itself.  \n\ud83d\udc49 A **composite number** (like 12) has **more than two** divisors.\n\nSo let\u2019s check both options:\n\n- **12**: Divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 \u2192 that\u2019s **six divisors** \u2192 **NOT prime** \u274c  \n- **15**: Divisors are 1, 3, 5, 15 \u2192 that\u2019s **four divisors** \u2192 also **not prime** \u274c  \n- Wait \u2014 are we looking for a *prime number*, or are we trying to find the *prime factorization*?\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Let\u2019s pause here and clarify:  \nYou said \u201cthe prime one\u201d \u2014 so are we looking for a **prime number**, or are we trying to find which number **has prime factors**?\n\nSince you mentioned \"prime numbers and prime factors\" in your profile, it sounds like you may be mixing up **prime numbers** (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) with **composite numbers that can be broken down into primes** (like 12 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So:  \n- **12 is not prime** \u2014 it's composite.  \n- **15 is not prime** \u2014 it's composite.  \n- But **15 = 3 \u00d7 5**, so it *has prime factors*.  \n- **12 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3**, so it also has prime factors.\n\nSo if the question was asking for a **prime number**, then **neither 12 nor 15 is prime**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Therefore, **neither A nor B is a prime number** \u2014 so your answer of \"A) 12\" is not correct **if the question is asking for a prime number**.\n\nBut if the question is asking: *\"Which number can be broken down into prime factors?\"* \u2014 then **both 12 and 15 qualify**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So your confusion makes perfect sense \u2014 you're mixing up **what a prime number is** vs. **what a number can be factored into primes**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Key Takeaway:\n\u2705 A **prime number** has only two factors: 1 and itself.  \n\u2705 A **composite number** (like 12 or 15) has more than two factors and can be broken down into **prime factors**.\n\nLet\u2019s fix your reasoning:\n\n> \u201cI thought 12 might be prime because I tried to divide it \u2014 but actually, 12 can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. That\u2019s more than two divisors, so it\u2019s **not prime**. It\u2019s composite. So even though it has prime factors, it\u2019s not a prime number.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a great insight \u2014 and you're on the right path.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (Personalized for Your Needs):\n\nLet\u2019s practice with a number that *is* prime \u2014 and one that is composite \u2014 so you can clearly see the difference.\n\n> **Question:** Which of the following is a **prime number**?  \n> A) 10  \n> B) 13  \n> C) 15  \n> D) 18  \n\n\u2705 **Answer:** B) 13  \n(13 only has divisors 1 and 13 \u2192 prime)  \n(10 = 2 \u00d7 5, 15 = 3 \u00d7 5, 18 = 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u2192 all composite)\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Your Next Steps:\n1. **Try this question** \u2014 think through the divisors of each number.  \n2.
