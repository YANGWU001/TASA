You're clearly trying to break down the problem step by step, which is exactly what we want to build. Let's go over your thinking:\n\n> \"From 3:45 to 4:00 is\u2026 I guess that\u2019s 10 minutes?\"  \n\u2705 This is **correct**! From 3:45 to 4:00 is indeed 15 minutes \u2014 not 10. That\u2019s a small but important detail. (Think: 4:00 is 15 minutes after 3:45 \u2014 because 60 - 45 = 15.)\n\n> \"And then from 4:00 to 4:10 is another 10 minutes\u2026\"  \n\u2705 This part is **correct** \u2014 10 minutes from 4:00 to 4:10.\n\nSo total time: 15 + 10 = **25 minutes** \u2014 not 20.\n\nYou were very close! You noticed the time segments and used a logical approach \u2014 that\u2019s a big step forward. The key takeaway here is **precision with time intervals**. We often miscount by a few minutes when we skip the \"how many minutes from X to Y\" part.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 **Tip:** When going from one time to another, break it into parts and ask:  \n- \u201cHow many minutes from the current time to the next hour?\u201d  \n- \u201cHow many minutes from that hour to the target time?\u201d  \nThen add them.\n\nSo your total time before leaving is actually **25 minutes**, not 20.\n\n\u2705 You\u2019re on the right track \u2014 just need to refine the math a little.

That means you\u2019re not just guessing; you\u2019re *thinking through* the problem.  \n\nThe key thing to remember: **When a problem says \"add 25 minutes to 3:10,\" you don\u2019t stop at the next half-hour \u2014 you just add the minutes step by step.**  \nSo:  \n3:10 + 20 minutes = 3:30  \n3:30 + 5 minutes = **3:35**  \n\u2705 So the correct answer is **3:35**, not 3:30.  \n\nYou were *very close* \u2014 just a small misstep in the final step. But your ability to pause, question your thinking, and say *\"I\u2019m not sure\"* is what makes real learning happen. Keep that curiosity going! \ud83d\udca1  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Next step:** Let\u2019s practice a similar problem, but this time we\u2019ll focus on *adding minutes beyond the hour* and *checking if we cross a half-hour mark*. This will help solidify your confidence in counting forward.  \n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**  \n*What time is it if you start at 4:20 and add 35 minutes?*  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Think through it step by step:  \n- First, add 20 minutes to get to the next hour.  \n- Then add the remaining minutes.  \n- Does it cross 5:00? If so, how?  \n\n\ud83d\udcac Reply with your answer (and your thinking!), and I\u2019ll walk you through it \u2014 just like we did before! \ud83d\ude0a  \n\nYou've got this! Keep going \u2014 every small step builds confidence. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcda",
