Since your student has shown **needs improvement** in *Linear Sequences (nth term)* with only **20% accuracy**, even though there were past instances of proficiency or mastery, we should design a **clear, step-by-step practice question** that builds confidence and reinforces foundational understanding.\n\nWe\u2019ll focus on a **simple, concrete example** with a visual or structured approach to reduce cognitive load and build accuracy.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Practice Question:**\n\nFind the **nth term** of this linear sequence:  \n**3, 7, 11, 15, 19, ...**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Step-by-step guidance to follow:**\n\n1. **Look at the pattern**: What do you notice about the numbers?  \n   (e.g., are they increasing by the same amount each time?)\n\n2. **Find the common difference (d)**:  \n   Subtract the first term from the second term.  \n   \u2192 7 \u2212 3 = ?\n\n3. **Use the formula**:  \n   For a linear sequence, the nth term is:  \n   **nth term = first term + (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 common difference**\n\n   \u2192 Plug in the values:  \n   first term = ?,  \n   common difference = ?  \n   So: nth term = ? + (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 ?\n\n4. **Simplify the expression** if possible.\n\n\u2705 **Tip**: Start by writing out the first few terms and see how the difference changes.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Why this works for the student**:  \n- The sequence is simple and follows a clear pattern.  \n- It avoids complex numbers or negative terms.  \n- The steps are broken down so the student can follow without getting overwhelmed.  \n- It builds confidence by starting with a known, easy pattern.\n\nLet me know when you'd like to go through the solution or try a follow-up question! \ud83d\ude0a",
