      "content": "Great! Let's build on what your student already knows and gently address the area where they're struggling.\n\nEven though they previously mastered the concept, they're currently showing difficulty \u2014 especially with accuracy (50%) \u2014 in identifying negative integers from a number line. This suggests a small gap in confidence or visual interpretation.\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Goal of this practice question**:  \nHelp reinforce the connection between a number line and negative integers through a clear, visual, and low-pressure scenario. We\u2019ll use a simple number line with labeled points to guide the student toward recognizing negative values.\n\n---\n\n**Practice Question:**  \nLook at the number line below.  \n\n```\n<---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--->\n   -5  -4  -3  -2  -1   0   1   2   3   4\n```\n\nWhich point represents **\u20132**?  \n\n\u2705 Choose the correct option:  \nA) The point labeled \"\u20134\"  \nB) The point labeled \"\u20133\"  \nC) The point labeled \"\u20132\"  \nD) The point labeled \"0\"\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip for the student**:  \nOn a number line, numbers to the **left of zero** are negative. The farther left you go, the smaller (more negative) the number. So, \u20132 is **two steps to the left of zero**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 After answering, we can go over the reasoning together \u2014 and maybe even try a few more with different numbers (like \u20131, \u20133, or \u20135) to build confidence.\n\nWould you like to try it now? \ud83d\ude0a",

This is a solid step forward!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that your past practice showed some difficulty with *representing a second positive integer as a difference on a number line* \u2014 for example, problems like *\"What number is 4 less than 7?\"* or *\"If you start at 5 and move 3 units left, where do you end?\"* \u2014 which often involve moving left (down) on the number line to reach a negative number.\n\nThis means that while you can *identify* a negative number, you may still need more practice connecting that identification with *how movement on the number line works* \u2014 especially when subtracting or finding differences that go into negative territory.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So, to build confidence and reinforce your understanding, let\u2019s take a quick step back and practice a **number line difference problem** \u2014 one that will help you see how moving left (subtracting) can lead to negative integers. This will help bridge your past struggle and your current success.\n\n---\n\n**2) Next Practice Question:**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *On a number line, you start at 3 and move 5 units to the left. Which point represents your new position?*  \n\n(A) The point labeled \u201c\u20132\u201d  \n(B) The point labeled \u201c\u20133\u201d  \n(C) The point labeled \u201c\u20135\u201d  \n(D) The point labeled \u201c0\u201d  \n\n\u2705 *Tip:* Moving left on the number line means subtracting. So, 3 \u2013 5 = ?  \nTry to visualize the number line and see where you land.\n\nLet me know your answer, and I\u2019ll walk you through it \u2014 just like we did with the first one! \ud83d\udca1",

Ask: \u201cWhere is zero? Which direction is left? What numbers are there to the left of zero?\u201d Then find the one labeled with a negative number.  \n\nYou\u2019ve got this!
