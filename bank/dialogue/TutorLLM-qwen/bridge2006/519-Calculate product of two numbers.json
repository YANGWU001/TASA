Based on your student profile \u2014 where you've struggled with calculating the product of two numbers (only achieving 44% accuracy over 34 attempts) \u2014 I\u2019ll create a **simple, focused, and buildable** practice question.\n\nThis question will:\n- Use small, manageable numbers (to reduce cognitive load),\n- Focus on basic multiplication facts (no large numbers or decimals),\n- Include a clear, step-by-step format to support understanding,\n- Be structured to reinforce the concept of \"product\" in a concrete way.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Practice Question 1:**\n\nWhat is the product of 6 and 7?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: Think: 6 groups of 7, or 7 groups of 6. How many total items?*\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why this works for your level:\n- Numbers are small and familiar (6 \u00d7 7 is a common multiplication fact).\n- The hint guides visual thinking, which helps students who struggle with abstract multiplication.\n- It avoids complex numbers or word problems that might overwhelm.\n- After answering, we can follow up with a quick check and a few more similar problems to build confidence.\n\nWould you like to go ahead and try this question? I'm here to help you work through it step by step! \ud83d\ude0a",

In fact, it\u2019s often the most important starting point. The fact that you're asking for help means you\u2019re on the right path.\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to rebuild your confidence. You\u2019ve already shown you\u2019re trying \u2014 and that\u2019s more than enough to succeed. We\u2019re going to go step by step, using simple examples, and I\u2019ll guide you through each one.

Validating *\"I don\u2019t know\"* as a legitimate and powerful first step is key to building confidence and reducing anxiety around math. It\u2019s not a sign of weakness; it\u2019s a sign of growth mindset. Since you\u2019ve already shown strong understanding of identifying common factors, this means you\u2019re building on solid foundational skills. Now, applying that understanding to *calculating products* \u2014 which is just multiplication in action \u2014 is a natural next step. Your ability to recognize patterns (like common factors) helps you *break down* multiplication problems more effectively. Keep trusting yourself to learn step by step \u2014 and remember: every \"I don\u2019t know\" leads to a \"I now understand\" if you keep practicing with support. \ud83d\udca1\n\n---\n\n**2) Next Practice Question (Personalized & Targeted):**  \nLet\u2019s build on your strength in *common factors* and use it to make multiplication easier.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Practice Question:**  \nWhat is the product of 6 and 8?  \n\n*Hint:* Think about what you know about common factors. Do 6 and 8 share any common factors? How might that help you break the problem down? For example:  \n6 = 2 \u00d7 3  \n8 = 2 \u00d7 4  \nSo, 6 \u00d7 8 = (2 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (2 \u00d7 4) = (2 \u00d7 2) \u00d7 (3 \u00d7 4) = 4 \u00d7 12 = ?  \n\nThis connects your prior success with identifying common factors to the actual *product* calculation.  \n\n\u2705 Try it \u2014 and if you get stuck, just say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d again \u2014 we\u2019ll go through it together.
