Since your student has shown progress but still needs improvement in **Identifying the larger quantity using addition**, let's create a **simple, clear, and supportive practice question** that builds confidence and reinforces the concept step by step.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Practice Question:**\n\nThere are **3 red apples** and **5 green apples** in a basket.  \nHow many apples are there in total?  \nWhich group has more apples \u2014 the red ones or the green ones?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Step-by-step guide to help you:**\n1. Add the two groups: 3 + 5 = ?\n2. Compare the two numbers: 3 or 5?\n3. The group with the bigger number has more apples.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip: When you add, you\u2019re combining both groups. But to find which group has more, just look at the original numbers \u2014 the bigger one is the larger group.*\n\n---\n\nLet me know when you're ready for the answer or want to try another one! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf4e",

Then the one that adds to 8 is larger.  \n\nTry it \u2014 don\u2019t rush. Just add the numbers and compare the totals.  \n\nWhen you're ready, reply with your answer (or say \"I still don't know\" \u2014 we\u2019ll go back to it together!).  \n\nYou've got this! \ud83d\udcaa",
