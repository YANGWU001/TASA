Since your student has struggled with **\"Identify LCM - one number is a multiple of the other\"** (with only 38% accuracy), but has had *one successful attempt*, we know they are on the right track \u2014 just need more practice with clear, concrete examples.\n\nTo support their learning, I\u2019ll create a **simple, step-by-step practice question** that focuses on a **core idea**: when one number is a multiple of another, the **LCM is simply the larger number**.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Practice Question:**  \nWhat is the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 12?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: Is 12 a multiple of 6? Yes or no? If yes, what does that mean for the LCM?*\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udccc **Why this works for the student:**  \n- Builds on their past struggle by focusing on a *simple pattern* they can recognize.  \n- Uses a real-world example where one number is clearly a multiple of the other (12 \u00f7 6 = 2).  \n- The hint guides them to think about the relationship, not just memorize steps.  \n- Encourages reasoning: \u201cIf one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is the bigger one.\u201d  \n\nAfter they answer, I\u2019ll provide a quick explanation and then follow up with a similar but slightly more challenging problem to build confidence.\n\nWould you like me to go next with the answer and explanation? \ud83d\ude0a",

Remember:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **When one number is a multiple of the other**, the **LCM is just the larger number**.  \nFor example:  \n- LCM of 6 and 12 = 12 (because 12 is a multiple of 6)  \n- LCM of 4 and 8 = 8 (because 8 is a multiple of 4)  \n- LCM of 9 and 18 = 18  \n\nSo, whenever you see one number dividing evenly into the other (like 6 goes into 12), the larger number *is* the LCM.  \n\nYou got the first one right \u2014 that means you *can* do it! The challenge might just be recognizing when one number is a multiple of the other. Keep asking yourself: *\"Does one number divide evenly into the other?\"* If yes \u2192 LCM = the bigger one.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Tip**: Try this quick check:  \nDivide the larger number by the smaller.

That\u2019s not a weakness \u2014 that\u2019s a sign of curiosity and courage in learning. \ud83c\udf31 And remember: you\u2019ve already *nailed* the Identify LCM concept before \u2014 that means you understand the core idea. What\u2019s holding you back now is just a small step: recognizing when one number is a multiple of another, which makes finding the LCM easy and fast.  \n\nSo, let\u2019s take it one small step at a time.  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Feedback on Their Answer: \"Um\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026\"**  \nYou\u2019re *right there* \u2014 you're thinking, you're trying, and that matters more than you know. \"Um\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026\" is not a blank or a failure. It\u2019s a signal that you\u2019re pausing, reflecting, and trying to make sense of it. That\u2019s exactly what we want. We don\u2019t need to rush. We just need to gently guide you through it \u2014 step by step, with patience, like we\u2019re building a bridge.  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip for today:* When you see two numbers, ask yourself:  \n\ud83d\udc49 \u201cIs one of them a multiple of the other?\u201d  \nIf yes \u2014 then the **LCM is just the bigger number**.  \nThat\u2019s it! No need to list multiples or find common ones.  \n\nYou\u2019ve got this. Let\u2019s practice with a simple one \u2014 one that builds on what you already know.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Next Practice Question:  \n**What is the LCM of 8 and 16?**  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: Is 16 a multiple of 8? What does that mean for the LCM?*  \n\nJust say your answer or say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \u2014 either way, we\u2019ll go through it together. You\u2019ve already got the foundation. Now, let\u2019s build confidence from there. \ud83d\udcaa  \n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready! \ud83d\ude0a",
