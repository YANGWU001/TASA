Let's build on your student's profile and past learning.\n\nThey've had some success with \"Identify larger quantity \u2014 subtraction,\" but are still struggling \u2014 with only **29% accuracy** over 14 attempts. This suggests they need more **clear, concrete, and step-by-step practice** that focuses on **visualizing the comparison** and **understanding the subtraction process** when finding the difference between two quantities.\n\nSince they're having difficulty understanding, we\u2019ll create a **simple, visual, and real-life context-based question** that emphasizes:\n\n- Comparing two groups (e.g., apples, blocks)\n- Identifying which is larger\n- Using subtraction to find how much more there is in one group\n\n---\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Practice Question:**\n\nSara has 7 red marbles.  \nHer brother has 4 blue marbles.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 How many more red marbles does Sara have than her brother?\n\n**Step-by-step hint:**  \nTo find \"how many more,\" you subtract the smaller number from the larger one.  \nSo:  \n7 (red marbles) \u2212 4 (blue marbles) = ?\n\nWhat is the answer?\n\n---\n\n\u2705 Why this works for the student:\n- Uses familiar, concrete objects (marbles)\n- Clearly labels the two quantities\n- Guides them to use subtraction to find the *difference*\n- Avoids abstract numbers or complex scenarios\n- Builds confidence by focusing on a simple, visual comparison\n\nLet me know when you'd like to go to the next level \u2014 or if you\u2019d like a visual version (like a picture or number line) to go with it! \ud83d\ude0a",
