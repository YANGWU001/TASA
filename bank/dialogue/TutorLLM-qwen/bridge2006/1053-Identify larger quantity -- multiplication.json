      "content": "Great! Based on your student profile \u2014 where you *aced* the concept in the past but *faced difficulty* with it recently (only 38% accuracy) \u2014 it seems the challenge now lies in **applying** the concept consistently, especially in identifying the larger quantity when multiplication is involved.\n\nTo support your learning, here\u2019s a **targeted, step-by-step practice question** designed to build confidence and reinforce understanding:\n\n---\n\n**\u2705 Practice Question: Identify the Larger Quantity \u2013 Multiplication**  \n\nSarah has 4 boxes of crayons. Each box contains 6 crayons.  \nTom has 5 boxes of crayons. Each box contains 5 crayons.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Question:** Who has more crayons in total?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Hint:** First, find out how many crayons each person has by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of crayons per box. Then compare the totals.\n\n---\n\n**What to do next:**  \n1. Multiply to find Sarah\u2019s total crayons:  \n   \u2192 4 boxes \u00d7 6 crayons = ______  \n2. Multiply to find Tom\u2019s total crayons:  \n   \u2192 5 boxes \u00d7 5 crayons = ______  \n3. Compare the two totals.  \n4. Circle: **Sarah** or **Tom** has more crayons.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Why this works for you:*  \n- It mirrors a problem you previously \"nailed\" \u2014 so you can use your past success as a foundation.  \n- It includes a clear step-by-step structure to reduce confusion.  \n- The numbers are simple enough to avoid getting lost in calculation, but still require careful comparison.  \n\nLet me know your answer \u2014 and I\u2019ll walk you through it with a quick explanation! \ud83d\ude0a",

In fact, that's exactly what we're here for: to *build confidence* when you don\u2019t know yet.  \n\nFrom your student profile, we see that you've *understood* the concept before \u2014 you even \"aced\" it in the past \u2014 but now you're facing difficulty *applying* it in practice. That\u2019s completely normal when a concept feels tricky after a break or when the numbers or context change.  \n\nThe fact that you're asking for help means you're already on the right path.
