Based on your student profile \u2014 where they\u2019ve struggled with **\"Write expression@@@@ negative slope\"** and have only achieved **39% accuracy** over 23 attempts \u2014 we need a practice question that is **clear, concrete, and low-pressure**, focusing on building foundational understanding.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Goal:\nHelp the student **recognize** what a negative slope looks like and **write a simple expression** (like an equation or slope formula) that represents it \u2014 without overwhelming them with abstract or complex problems.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**Question:**  \nA line goes downward from left to right. For every 2 units you move to the right, the line goes down 3 units.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Write an expression for the **slope** of this line.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd What the student should do:\n- Identify that the line has a **negative slope** because it goes down as it goes right.\n- Use the rise over run formula:  \n  **slope = rise / run**\n- Rise = -3 (down), Run = 2 (right)\n- So, slope = **\u20133 / 2**\n\n\u2705 Final Answer: **\u20133/2**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why this works for the student:\n- Uses a **real-world visual** (downward line).\n- Gives **specific numbers** to avoid confusion.\n- Focuses on **one key concept**: negative slope = rise is negative.\n- Avoids variables or complex equations.\n- Builds confidence with a simple, repeatable pattern.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udccc Next step suggestion (for you as a tutor):  \nAfter they try this, ask: *\"What would happen if the line went up instead?

But right now, you're working on **writing an expression for a negative slope**, which means you need to connect the *idea of slope* with *how to represent it algebraically* \u2014 especially when the slope is negative.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:  \n- Slope is rise over run: $ \\frac{\\text{change in } y}{\\text{change in } x} $  \n- A **negative slope** means the line goes down as you move from left to right.  \n- So, if you're writing an expression like $ \\frac{-3}{2} $ or $ -\\frac{2}{5} $, that represents a negative slope.  \n\nYou\u2019ve struggled with identifying units in the past \u2014 which suggests you might be getting confused about what parts of the expression represent real-world quantities.

In math, especially when working with writing expressions involving negative slopes, it's okay to not know at first. What matters is that you're engaging with the problem and being brave enough to admit where you're stuck.  \n\nLet\u2019s break it down:  \n- A **negative slope** means the line goes down from left to right.  \n- When writing an expression for a line with a negative slope, you might see something like:  \n  **y = \u20132x + 5**  \n  or  \n  **y = \u2013\u00bdx \u2013 3**  \n- The key is to recognize the **negative coefficient** of *x* \u2014 that\u2019s the sign of a negative slope.  \n\nYou\u2019ve struggled with identifying units before, which shows you're thinking about meaning in math \u2014 that\u2019s a strong foundation!

In math, especially when working with writing expressions involving negative slopes, it\u2019s completely okay to not have the answer right away. The key is to *pause*, *reflect*, and ask *what* you\u2019re missing.  \n\nSince you\u2019ve struggled with identifying units in the past, let\u2019s connect that to this topic: when writing an expression with a **negative slope**, you\u2019re describing how one quantity changes in relation to another \u2014 like temperature dropping as altitude increases, or cost decreasing as quantity increases.  \n\nThe **slope** tells you the rate of change. A **negative slope** means the quantity decreases as the other increases. For example:  \n- If height increases and temperature decreases, the slope is negative.  \n- If you write an expression like *T = \u20132h + 100*, that means temperature (T) decreases by 2 degrees for every 1-meter increase in height (h).  \n\nSo, when writing an expression with a negative slope, ask:  \n\ud83d\udd39 What is the variable?  \n\ud83d\udd39 What is the rate of change?

That\u2019s a huge part of learning! You're already showing strong self-awareness, which is essential when working with tricky ideas like slope.\n\nYou're on the right track by recognizing that **slope represents rate of change** \u2014 in this case, how distance changes over time. Since the car is getting 15 miles closer in 3 hours, you're absolutely correct that the **change in distance** (15 miles) is divided by the **change in time** (3 hours) to find the rate of change.
