Based on your student profile \u2014 where they are working to improve **\"Using difficult numbers\"** with only **40% accuracy** over 15 attempts \u2014 I\u2019ll design a **clear, focused, and manageable practice question** that builds confidence while targeting the specific challenge.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Goal:\nHelp the student practice **working with difficult numbers** (like decimals, fractions, or large numbers) in a **realistic, low-pressure context** \u2014 without overwhelming them.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Practice Question:  \n**Solve the following problem step by step.**  \n\n*Lisa has 3.75 liters of juice. She pours out 1.2 liters and then adds 0.5 liters more. How much juice does she have now?*\n\n**Step-by-step instructions:**  \n1. Start with the initial amount: 3.75 liters.  \n2. Subtract the amount poured out: 1.2 liters.  \n3. Add the amount she added back: 0.5 liters.  \n4. Write your final answer as a decimal (e.g., 2.5).  \n\n\u2705 **Tip:** Line up the decimal points when adding or subtracting. This helps avoid mistakes with difficult numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Why this works for your student:\n- Uses **common difficult numbers** (3.75, 1.2, 0.5) that are not whole numbers \u2014 which they\u2019ve struggled with before.  \n- Involves **two operations** (subtraction and addition), which builds fluency.  \n- Emphasizes **decimal alignment** \u2014 a common error point.  \n- Keeps the context **real-world and relatable** (juice) to improve engagement.  \n- Is **simple enough** to build confidence, not overwhelming.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 After they attempt it, we\u2019ll go over the steps together and identify any decimal alignment or mental math errors.  \n\nWould you like to try it now? \ud83d\ude0a",
