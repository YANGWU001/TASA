You haven\u2019t tried the new problem yet, so there\u2019s nothing to mark right or wrong. What matters now is figuring out which part of the process feels fuzzy (finding a common factor? doing the cancellation? the final multiplication?) so we can clear it up together.\n\n---\n\n## Let\u2019s break the next problem into bite\u2011size pieces\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\frac{8}{15}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{21}{32}}\n\\]\n\nWe\u2019ll walk through the four steps **one at a time**. Write down (or type) each answer before moving on.\n\n| Step | What to do | Prompt for you |\n|------|------------|----------------|\n| **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Find a pair that shares a factor** | Look at every numerator\u2011denominator combination and spot a common divisor >\u202f1. | *Which numerator can be paired with which denominator? List the possible common factors.* |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Cancel that factor** | Divide **both** numbers in the chosen pair by the common factor. (Do this for every pair you find; the order doesn\u2019t matter.) | *Write the fraction after you cancel the first factor you found.* |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Multiply the remaining tops and bottoms** | Multiply the remaining numerators together and the remaining denominators together. | *What product do you get after cancellation?* |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Check for any further reduction** | See if the numerator and denominator still share a factor >\u202f1. If they do, divide it out. | *Is the final fraction already in simplest form?* |\n\n### Your first prompt\n\n**Step\u202f1:**  \nLook at the numbers 8,\u202f15,\u202f21,\u202f32.  \n\n- Does **8** share a factor with **15**?  \n- Does **8** share a factor with **32**?  \n- Does **21** share a factor with **15**?  \n- Does **21** share a factor with **32**?\n\nWrite down the factor(s) you see (you may find more than one). If you get stuck, just tell me which pair you\u2019re looking at and I\u2019ll give a hint.  \n\n---\n\n### If you\u2019d prefer a slightly easier warm\u2011up first\n\nSometimes it helps to practice a single cancellation before tackling two at once. Try this short problem:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{9}\\times\\frac{4}{10}\n\\]\n\n*Identify one common factor, cancel it, then finish the multiplication.*  \n\nDoing this quick warm\u2011up can boost your confidence, and then we\u2019ll jump back to the original \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\times\\frac{21}{32}\\) problem.\n\n---\n\n**What to do next**\n\n1. Try the warm\u2011up (or go straight to Step\u202f1 of the main problem).  \n2. Post your answer for the step you attempted, or let me know which part feels unclear.  \n\nYou\u2019ve already shown you can spot common factors (you did it correctly with the previous example), so you\u2019re more than capable of handling this.
