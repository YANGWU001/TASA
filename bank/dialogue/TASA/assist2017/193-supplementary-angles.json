The larger angle is **five times the smaller angle minus\u202f40\u00b0**.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Larger angle}=5(\\text{Smaller angle})-40^\\circ\n\\]\n\nBelow is a *guided worksheet*. Fill in each blank; you can write the answer in the space provided or just say it out loud. When you\u2019re ready, send me the completed line(s) and we\u2019ll move on.\n\n| Step | What to do | Your work (fill in) |\n|------|------------|---------------------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Introduce a variable** \u2013 Let the smaller angle be \u2026 | \\(x\\) degrees |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Write the \u201csum\u2011to\u2011180\u00b0\u201d sentence** \u2013 \u201cThe two angles add to 180\u00b0.\u201d Replace each angle with its expression. | \\( \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}} + \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}} = 180\\) |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Plug in the expressions** \u2013 smaller = \\(x\\); larger = \\(5x-40\\). | \\( x + (5x-40) = 180\\) |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Combine like terms** \u2013 add the \\(x\\)\u2019s and keep the constant. | \\( \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}} = 180\\) |\n| 5\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Isolate the variable** \u2013 first **subtract 40** from both sides. | \\( \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}} = 180-40\\) |\n| 6\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Simplify the right\u2011hand side**. | \\( \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}} = 140\\) |\n| 7\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Divide by the coefficient** (the number in front of \\(x\\)). | \\( x = \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}}\\) |\n| 8\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Find the larger angle** \u2013 substitute your \\(x\\) into \\(5x-40\\). | Larger = \\( \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}}\\) |\n| 9\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Check** \u2013 add the two angles and make sure they equal 180\u00b0. | \\( \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}} + \\underline{\\hspace{2cm}} = 180^\\circ\\) |\n\n---\n\n#### How to use the worksheet  \n\n1. **Copy the table** into your reply (or just type the missing pieces).  \n2. **Fill in each blank** one at a time. If you get stuck on a particular step, let me know which one, and I\u2019ll give a short hint just for that step.  \n3. Once you\u2019ve completed the table, we\u2019ll confirm the answer together and move on to a slightly tougher challenge (still the same \u201csupplementary\u2011angle\u201d pattern, but with a different coefficient).\n\nYou\u2019ve already mastered the hardest part\u2014*setting up* the equation. Now it\u2019s just a quick arithmetic sweep. Give it a try; I\u2019m here if you need a nudge! \ud83c\udf1f",
