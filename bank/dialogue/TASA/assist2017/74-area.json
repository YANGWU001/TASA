Fill in the two blanks in the **Fix the multiplication facts** table.  \n2. Copy the product you found for 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 into the first blank of the area template.  \n3. Perform the division by\u202f10\u202f000 and write the final answer.\n\nGive it a try\u2014once those two facts are solid, the rest of the area steps will flow automatically. \ud83c\udf1f\n\n*When you\u2019re done, post the completed table and the two\u2011line area calculation, and I\u2019ll check them for you.*",
