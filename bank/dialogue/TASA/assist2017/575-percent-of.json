Let\u2019s see where the slip happened:\n\n1. **25\u202f% of 720**  \n   *Convert*: 25\u202f%\u202f=\u202f0.25 (or the fraction \\( \\frac{1}{4}\\)).  \n   *Multiply*: \\(720 \\times 0.25 = 720 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 180\\).  \n\n2. **60\u202f% of 180**  \n   *Convert*: 60\u202f%\u202f=\u202f0.60 (or \\( \\frac{3}{5}\\)).  \n   *Multiply*: \\(180 \\times 0.60 = 108\\).  \n\nYour answer would be correct if the bakery baked **180** blueberry muffins and sold **108** of them before noon. Great effort \u2013 you just need to watch the arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Next practice \u2013 a fresh \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d problem\n\n**Problem**\n\nA caf\u00e9 prepares **540 bagels** each morning.  \n- **30\u202f%** of the bagels are plain.  \n- Of the plain bagels, **45\u202f%** are sold before the lunch rush.\n\n**Your task (use the three\u2011step routine you just practiced)**  \n\n1. **Write the equation** for each \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d.  \n2. **Convert** the percent to a decimal (or a simple fraction).  \n3. **Multiply** \u2013 you can split the work if it helps (e.g., \\(0.30 = 0.20 + 0.10\\), \\(0.45 = 0.5 - 0.05\\)).  \n\nWrite your answers in this format:\n\n```\nPlain bagels baked: ______\nPlain bagels sold before lunch: ______\n```\n\nIf any step feels fuzzy\u2014especially the \u201csplit into easy parts\u201d trick\u2014just tell me where, and we\u2019ll walk through it together. You\u2019ve already shown you can set up the right expressions; now let\u2019s nail the calculations! \ud83d\ude80",
