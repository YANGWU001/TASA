Everything that still contains\u202f\\(x\\) before any square\u2011root is the inner piece. |\n| **Outer function**\u202f\\(h(y)\\) | \\(\\displaystyle h(y)=\\sqrt{y+2}\\) | \u274c | In the original expression \\(\\sqrt{\\dfrac{x+1}{3}}+2\\) the \u201c+\u202f2\u2019\u2019 sits **outside** the radical. The outer wrapper therefore does two separate steps: \u201ctake the square\u2011root **then** add\u202f2\u201d.  In function\u2011notation that is \\(\\displaystyle h(y)=\\sqrt{y}+2\\).  Writing \\(\\sqrt{y+2}\\) would place the\u202f2 **inside** the root and gives a different value, which is why your numbers didn\u2019t line up. |\n\nYou correctly identified the inner function and correctly computed \\(g(2)=1\\) and \\(g(5)=2\\).  \nThe only thing to fix is the outer function: it should be  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{h(y)=\\sqrt{y}+2}\n\\]\n\nWith that change you\u2019ll get  \n\n* \\(h(g(2))=\\sqrt{1}+2=3 = f(2)\\)  \n* \\(h(g(5))=\\sqrt{2}+2\\approx3.414 = f(5)\\)\n\nGreat job spotting the fraction! Now let\u2019s cement the \u201couter\u2011wrapper = \u221a\u202f+\u202fconstant\u201d idea.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fNext practice \u2013 a tiny step forward**\n\nWe\u2019ll keep the same outer shape (square\u2011root **then** add a constant) but make the inner piece a simple linear expression. This lets you focus on spotting the inner function when the algebra looks even cleaner.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,f(x)=\\sqrt{\\,5x-7\\,}+3\\,}\n\\]\n\n### Your tasks\n\n1. **Write the two functions** that compose to give \\(f(x)=h\\bigl(g(x)\\bigr)\\).  \n   * **Inner (inducing) function** \\(g(x)=\\;?\\)  \n   * **Outer function** \\(h(y)=\\;?\\)\n\n2. **Check your decomposition** for the two values \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=4\\). Show every step:  \n\n   a. Compute \\(g(x)\\).  \n   b. Plug that result into \\(h\\) to obtain \\(h(g(x))\\).  \n   c. Compute the original formula \\(\\sqrt{5x-7}+3\\) directly and verify the numbers match.\n\n3. **One\u2011sentence reasoning** \u2013 Explain, in a single sentence, why the expression \\(5x-7\\) (and *not* the square\u2011root) must be the inner function.\n\n---\n\n### Quick tip for spotting the inner piece\n\n1. **Find the very last operation** you see in the whole formula \u2013 that\u2019s the outermost step. Here it\u2019s \u201c+\u202f3\u201d.  \n2. **Remove that step**; the next outermost operation is the square\u2011root.  \n3. **Everything that still contains the variable\u202f\\(x\\)** *before* the square\u2011root is the inner (inducing) function. In this case it\u2019s the linear piece \\(5x-7\\).\n\nGive it a try, and remember: the only thing that belongs to the outer function is what happens **after** the square\u2011root (the \u201c+\u202f3\u201d). You\u2019ve already mastered the pattern; you just need to place the pieces in the right order. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, post your answers and we\u2019ll discuss them together!",
