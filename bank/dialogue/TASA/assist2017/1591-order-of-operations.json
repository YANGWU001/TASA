That\u2019s a good first step \u2013 you recognized you need to begin with the parentheses.  \nWhat\u2019s missing is the actual work for **Step\u202f1 (Parentheses)** and the rest of the rows. Because the table is incomplete we can\u2019t yet tell whether the intermediate results are right or wrong, but the important thing is that you\u2019re on the right track by breaking the problem into bite\u2011size pieces.\n\n**Where to focus next**\n\n1. **Complete Step\u202f1:** evaluate everything *inside* the parentheses, **including any exponents that appear there**.  \n2. **Step\u202f2 (Exponents):** if any exponent remains after you\u2019ve dealt with the parentheses, compute it.  \n3. **Step\u202f3 (Multiplication\u202f\u00f7\u202fDivision):** scan the whole expression left\u2011to\u2011right and do each division or multiplication you see, in the order you meet them.  \n4. **Step\u202f4 (Addition\u202f\u00f7\u202fSubtraction):** finish with the remaining plus/minus, also left\u2011to\u2011right.\n\nLet\u2019s finish the current problem together, and then move on to a fresh one that will give you extra practice with the left\u2011to\u2011right rule for multiplication and division.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Finish the current table (you can copy\u2011paste)\n\n| Step | What to do | Write the intermediate result |\n|------|------------|--------------------------------|\n| **1. Parentheses** | Simplify \\((8-3^{2})\\). | |\n| **2. Exponents** | (If any exponent is left after Step\u202f1) evaluate it. | |\n| **3. Multiplication\u202f\u00f7\u202fDivision** | Work left\u2011to\u2011right on the whole expression. | |\n| **4. Addition\u202f\u00f7\u202fSubtraction** | Finish left\u2011to\u2011right. | |\n| **5.

Multiplication\u202f\u00f7\u202fDivision** | Scan left\u2011to\u2011right across the whole expression and do each division or multiplication you encounter. | |\n| **4. Addition\u202f\u00f7\u202fSubtraction** | Finish left\u2011to\u2011right with any addition or subtraction left. | |\n| **5. Final answer** | | |\n\n**Tiny starter hint**\n\n- Inside the first parentheses: \\(5 + 3^{2}\\). Compute the exponent \\(3^{2}=9\\) first, then add 5 \u2192 you\u2019ll get **14**.\n- The second parentheses \\((2+1)\\) become **3**.\n\nUse those numbers in the next step (division) and keep the left\u2011to\u2011right rule for the remaining operations.\n\n---\n\n**What to do now**\n\n1. Finish the table for the **(8\u20113\u00b2)+12\u00f74\u00d72** problem.  \n2. Then start the new table for the **(5+3\u00b2) \u00f7 (2+1) \u2013 6\u00d72** problem.\n\nIf any step feels unclear, just point it out and I\u2019ll give a targeted hint.
