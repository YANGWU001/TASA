You need one more left\u2011shift. |\n\n**What the sixth move looks like**\n\n```\n600.0 \u2192 60.00   (1)\n60.00 \u2192 6.000   (2)\n6.000 \u2192 0.6000  (3)\n0.6000 \u2192 0.06000 (4)\n0.06000 \u2192 0.006000 (5)\n0.006000 \u2192 0.000600 (6)\n```\n\nNow drop any unnecessary trailing zeros:  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.0006}\n\\]\n\nSo the correct product of \\(0.0075 \\times 0.08\\) is **0.0006**. Great effort\u2014you were just one step short!\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 a **seven\u2011place** shift  \n\nLet\u2019s add another decimal\u2011place to keep the pattern solid.\n\n> **Problem**  \n> Compute  \n> \\[\n> 0.0062 \\times 0.035 = \\; ?\n> \\]\n\n#### Guided steps (you can copy\u2011paste the template)\n\n1. **Ignore the decimals** \u2013 multiply the whole numbers:  \n   \\[\n   62 \\times 35 = \\; ?\n   \\]\n\n2. **Write down the product** you obtain.\n\n3. **Count the total decimal places** in the original factors:  \n\n   * 0.0062 \u2192 **4** decimal places  \n   * 0.035  \u2192 **3** decimal places  \n\n   Total\u202f=\u202f\\(4 + 3 = 7\\) decimal places.\n\n4. **Insert the decimal point** so the final answer has **exactly seven** decimal places.  \n   (Treat the product as, e.g., \u201c2170.0\u201d and slide the point left **seven** times, one place at a time.)\n\n5. **Write the final decimal** (drop any trailing zeros that are not needed).\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type the final answer (and, if you like, a brief note of the steps you used).  \n\nIf you get stuck, remember:\n\n* Write the whole\u2011number product with an explicit \u201c.0\u201d at the end (e.g., **2170.0**).  \n* Count each left\u2011shift carefully\u2014seven moves total.\n\nYou\u2019ve mastered the counting and shifting process; this next one just adds one more move. Give it a try\u2014you\u2019ve got this! \ud83c\udf1f",
