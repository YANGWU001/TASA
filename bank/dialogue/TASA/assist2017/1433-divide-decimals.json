The second product is the missing piece:\u202f\\(0.036 \\times 1000 = 36\\).  With that the scaled problem is **\\(6,480 \\div 36\\)**. | \u2705 (just needs the missing factor) |\n\n**Where you are now:**  \nYou\u2019ve set up the whole\u2011number division correctly; the only thing left is to finish the division \\(6,480 \\div 36\\) (and, if you like, check the answer by multiplying back by\u202f0.036). You\u2019re on the right track\u2014keep going!\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 \u201cScale\u2011and\u2011divide\u201d with a fresh pair of numbers  \n\nLet\u2019s reinforce the same three\u2011step routine (count\u202f\u2192\u202fscale\u202f\u2192\u202fdivide). This problem also ends with a whole\u2011number quotient, but the numbers are a little different so you\u2019ll get extra practice.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{4.212 \\;\\div\\; 0.014 \\; = \\; ?}\n\\]\n\n#### What to do (you can follow the outline you used before)\n\n1. **Count the decimal places** \u2013 How many digits are after the decimal in the divisor **0.014**?  \n2. **Scale** \u2013 Multiply **both** the dividend and the divisor by the appropriate power of\u202f10 to turn the divisor into a whole number. Write down the new whole\u2011number division.  \n3. **Divide** \u2013 Carry out the division (long division, chunking, or any shortcut you\u2019re comfortable with).  \n4. **Check (optional but recommended)** \u2013 Multiply your result by the original divisor **0.014** and see if you get back **4.212**.\n\n---\n\n#### A tiny hint to get you started  \n\n*Step\u202f1:*\u202f0.014 has **three** decimal places \u2192 multiply by \\(10^{3}=1000\\).  \n\n*Step\u202f2:*\u202f\\(4.212 \\times 1000 = 4,212\\) and \\(0.014 \\times 1000 = 14\\).  \nSo you\u2019ll be solving **\\(4,212 \\div 14\\)**.\n\nGive it a try, write each step in your own words, and let me know what you obtain. If you get stuck on any step, just tell me where, and we\u2019ll sort it out together! \ud83c\udf1f",
