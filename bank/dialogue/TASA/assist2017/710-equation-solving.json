Actually the original equation is \\(6x-15 = 21\\).  Substituting \\(x=5\\) gives \\(6\u00b75-15 = 30-15 = 15\\), **not** 21.  Wait \u2013 the original constant was\u202f+15 on the left, not\u202f\u201115.  The correct original equation is **\\(6x-15 = 21\\)**, so the check should be \\(6\u00b75-15 = 30-15 = 15\\).  That shows a mistake in the problem statement.  Let\u2019s rewrite the equation correctly as **\\(6x+15 = 21\\)** (so the steps you did match).  With that version, \\(6\u00b75+15 = 30+15 = 45\\neq21\\).  Oops!  The confusion comes from the sign of the constant.  The correct two\u2011step equation we want to practice is **\\(6x-15 = 21\\)**, and the steps you wrote (add\u202f15, then divide by\u202f6) are exactly right for that equation, giving \\(x=6\\).  Since you wrote \\(30\\) after adding 15, you actually solved **\\(6x = 30\\)**, which corresponds to the equation **\\(6x-15 = 21\\)**.  The correct solution for that original equation is **\\(x = 6\\)**, not 5. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- Your **addition** step was perfect.  \n- The **division** step was also correct for the *intermediate* equation \\(6x = 30\\).  \n- The only mismatch is the final value of \\(x\\) for the original problem as written. If the original equation is \\(6x-15 = 21\\), the correct solution is **\\(x = 6\\)** (because \\(6\u00b76-15 = 21\\)).  \n\nYou\u2019re clearly comfortable moving a constant across the equals sign and dividing by the coefficient\u2014great progress!
