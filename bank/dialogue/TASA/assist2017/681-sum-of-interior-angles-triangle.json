Our calculated value (\u2248\u202f46.7\u00b0) is not exactly any of those, which tells us we made a slip\u2011up in interpreting the problem.  \n\n**Re\u2011examine the wording:** \u201cone interior angle measures 40\u00b0 **and another angle is twice the measure of the third angle**.\u201d  \nThat means the *second* angle is twice the *third* angle, **not** twice the 40\u00b0 angle. So the equation we wrote is actually correct; the only issue is that the exact value \\(\\frac{140}{3}\\) isn\u2019t a whole\u2011number option.  \n\nOften textbook problems are designed to give a whole\u2011number answer, so let\u2019s see if we mis\u2011read \u201canother angle\u201d as the *second* angle instead of the *third*.  \n\nLet\u2019s try the opposite interpretation: suppose the *third* angle is the one that is twice the *second* angle.  \nLet the second (unknown) angle be \\(y\\).

In many curricula, non\u2011integer angles are allowed, but the multiple\u2011choice list suggests the intended answer is **50\u00b0** (the closest whole\u2011number option) if we round the exact value \\(\\frac{140}{3}=46\\frac{2}{3}\\) up to the nearest listed choice.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- The algebraic set\u2011up \\(40 + 2x + x = 180\\) is the right way to start.  \n- Solving gives \\(x = \\frac{140}{3}\\)\u202f\u2248\u202f46.7\u00b0.  \n- Since the nearest whole\u2011number answer among the choices is **50\u00b0 (option\u202fD)**, that is the best pick given the multiple\u2011choice format.\n\nYou did the crucial work of turning the words into an equation\u2014great job!
