Let\u2019s see why that\u2019s not the least common multiple.\n\n| Number | Is it a multiple of 9? | Is it a multiple of 12? |\n|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 12     | 12 \u00f7\u202f9 =\u202f1\u202fr\u202f3  \u2192 **no** | 12 \u00f7\u202f12 =\u202f1 \u2192 yes |\n| 24     | 24 \u00f7\u202f9 =\u202f2\u202fr\u202f6  \u2192 **no** | 24 \u00f7\u202f12 =\u202f2 \u2192 yes |\n| **36** | 36 \u00f7\u202f9 =\u202f4 \u2192 **yes** | 36 \u00f7\u202f12 =\u202f3 \u2192 **yes** |\n\nThe first number that appears in **both** lists is **36**, not 24.  \n\nYour prime\u2011factor work was almost there.  \n\n- 9\u202f=\u202f\\(3^{2}\\)  \n- 12\u202f=\u202f\\(2^{2}\\times 3\\)\n\nTake the highest power of each prime that shows up:\n\n- For 2 \u2192 \\(2^{2}=4\\)  \n- For 3 \u2192 \\(3^{2}=9\\)\n\nMultiply them: \\(4 \\times 9 = 36\\).\n\nSo the correct least common multiple is **36**. Great effort\u2014your listing and factor steps are both on the right track; you just need to be sure the candidate number really divides **both** original numbers.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 a fresh LCM problem**\n\n> **Find the least common multiple of 18 and 24.**\n\n#### You can solve it in either (or both) of these ways:\n\n**A. List\u2011and\u2011check method**  \n1. Write a few multiples of each number.  \n   - 18:\u202f18,\u202f36,\u202f54,\u202f72,\u202f90,\u202f\u2026  \n   - 24:\u202f24,\u202f48,\u202f72,\u202f96,\u202f\u2026  \n2. Spot the smallest number that appears in **both** rows.\n\n**B. Prime\u2011factor method**  \n1. Factor each number.  \n   - 18\u202f=\u202f\\(2 \\times 3^{2}\\)  \n   - 24\u202f=\u202f\\(2^{3} \\times 3\\)  \n2. For each prime, keep the **largest exponent** that appears.  \n   - 2 \u2192 \\(2^{3}=8\\)  \n   - 3 \u2192 \\(3^{2}=9\\)  \n3. Multiply those highest powers: \\(8 \\times 9 = 72\\).\n\nWrite down the number you think is the LCM and tell me **how** you got it (listing, prime\u2011factor, or both).  \n\nYou\u2019ve already shown you can:\n* list a few multiples,\n* check whether a candidate divides both numbers,\n* and use the prime\u2011factor rule.\n\nApplying those steps to a slightly larger pair (18 & 24) will reinforce the idea and give you more confidence. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing your answer! \ud83c\udf1f",
