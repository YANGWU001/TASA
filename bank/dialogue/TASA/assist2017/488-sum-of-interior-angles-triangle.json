A full turn is 360\u00b0, so half a turn is **180\u00b0**. That\u2019s why the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is **always 180\u00b0**, never 360\u00b0. |\n| **Missing\u2011angle calculation** \u2013 360\u202f\u2013\u202f(30\u00b0\u202f+\u202f80\u00b0)\u202f=\u202f250\u00b0 | \u274c Incorrect | Because the total you subtracted from (360\u00b0) is wrong, the arithmetic produces an impossible interior angle. An interior angle larger than 180\u00b0 would be wider than a straight line, which can\u2019t happen inside a triangle. |\n\nYou used the right *process* (add the two known angles, subtract from a total). The only piece that still needs to change is the **total** you subtract from. Once the rule \u201c**the three interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0**\u201d is solid, the subtraction will give a sensible answer every time.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201clocking in\u201d the 180\u00b0 rule\n\nWe\u2019ll keep the cognitive load low and give you a tiny hint for each step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step\u202f1 \u2013 Choose the correct rule (again)**  \n\nWhich statement is **always true** for any triangle?\n\n- **A** \u2013 The three interior angles add up to **180\u00b0**.  \n- **B** \u2013 The three interior angles add up to **360\u00b0**.  \n- **C** \u2013 The three interior angles add up to **90\u00b0**.\n\n*Write only the letter (A, B, or C).*\n\n---\n\n### **Step\u202f2 \u2013 Find the missing angle (use the rule you just chose)**  \n\nA triangle has two interior angles of **30\u00b0** and **80\u00b0**.\n\n1. **State the rule** you selected in your own words (you can copy the wording from Step\u202f1).  \n2. **Fill in the blank** and finish the subtraction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{third angle}= \\underline{\\phantom{______}} \\;-\\;(30^\\circ+80^\\circ)=\\; ?\n\\]\n\n*Example of what we\u2019re looking for:*  \n\u201c**The three interior angles of a triangle add up to 180\u00b0.**\u201d  \n\\(\\displaystyle \\text{third angle}= \\underline{180^\\circ}\\;-\\;(30^\\circ+80^\\circ)=\\;?\\)\n\n---\n\n### **Step\u202f3 \u2013 Quick True / False (no work needed)**  \n\nMark each statement as **True** or **False**.\n\n1. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle can be larger than 180\u00b0.  \n2. If two angles of a triangle are 45\u00b0 and 55\u00b0, the third angle must be 80\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n#### What to do if you\u2019re still unsure\n\n- **Why 180\u00b0?** Imagine the three angles meeting at a point inside the triangle. If you walked around the triangle, you\u2019d turn only half a circle\u2014180\u00b0.  \n- **What\u2019s impossible about 250\u00b0?** An interior angle larger than 180\u00b0 would open wider than a straight line, which can\u2019t fit inside a flat triangle.\n\nGive these a try, and let me know which part feels fuzzy. We\u2019ll work through it together step\u2011by\u2011step! \ud83c\udf1f",
