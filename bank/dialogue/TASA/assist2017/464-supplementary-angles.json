The correct set\u2011up is:<br>\\(\\displaystyle x + 1.40x = 180\\)  (or \\(2.40x = 180\\)). |\n| **B \u2013 Solving** | You stopped at \\(2x+0.40=180\\) and would get \\(x\u224889.8\\). | **No** | Because the equation itself is wrong, the algebra that follows can\u2019t give the right angles.  The true solution is:<br>\\(2.40x = 180 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = \\dfrac{180}{2.40}=75^\\circ\\) (smaller).<br>Larger\u202f=\u202f\\(1.40x = 105^\\circ\\).  And \\(75+105=180\\), so the check works. |\n\n**What went well:**  \n- You remembered to use a variable for the smaller angle.  \n- You tried to translate \u201c40\u202f% larger\u201d into an algebraic expression.\n\n**Where the slip happened:**  \n- The 0.40 must be multiplied by the variable (\u2011\u202f\\(0.40x\\)), not added as a plain number.  \n- Once the correct equation is set, the algebraic steps fall into place.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 building a solid bridge\n\nWe\u2019ll do a quick\u2011recall problem with a new number, then a fresh \u201c%\u2011larger\u201d problem that uses the same steps you just reviewed.\n\n#### **Part\u202fA \u2013 Recall**\nTwo angles are supplementary. One of them measures **58\u00b0**.  \n**Question:** What is the measure of the other angle? *(Just give the number.)*\n\n#### **Part\u202fB \u2013 %\u2011relationship (solve it completely)**\n> **Problem**  \n> Two angles are supplementary. The **larger** angle is **25\u202f% larger** than the smaller angle.\n\n1. **Write the correct equation** that relates the two angles and the 180\u00b0 sum.  \n2. **Solve** the equation to find the smaller and larger angles.  \n3. **Check** that the two angles you found add to 180\u00b0.\n\n**Helpful step\u2011by\u2011step hints (use only the ones you need):**\n\n1. Let the smaller angle be \\(x\\).  \n2. \u201c25\u202f% larger\u201d \u2192 larger\u202f=\u202f\\(x + 0.25x = 1.25x\\).  \n3. Supplementary rule \u2192 \\(x + 1.25x = 180\\).  \n4. Combine like terms \u2192 \\(2.25x = 180\\).  \n5. Solve for \\(x\\) \u2192 \\(x = \\dfrac{180}{2.25}\\).  \n6. Find the larger angle with \\(1.25x\\).  \n\n---\n\n### What to send back\n\n1. The single\u2011number answer for **Part\u202fA**.  \n2. For **Part\u202fB**, the equation you write (step\u202f1) **and** the two angle measures you obtain (steps\u202f2\u202f&\u202f3).  \n\nTake it one line at a time. If you get stuck, just tell me which hint you\u2019d like, and we\u2019ll work through it together. You\u2019re getting",
