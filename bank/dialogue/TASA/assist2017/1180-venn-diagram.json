Great job \u2013 you kept the \u201cboth\u201d slice out just where it belongs.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next step \u2013 \u201cat least one\u201d**\n\nNow let\u2019s apply the same idea to the second part of the problem.\n\n### Question\u202fB (challenge)  \nHow many students attend **at least one** of the two workshops (writing **or** speaking, *including* those who do both)?\n\n| Group | Number |\n|-------|--------|\n| Only\u202fW | 7 |\n| Only\u202fX | 12 |\n| Both   | 5 |\n| Neither| 8 |\n\n**Choices**\u2003A.\u202f19\u2003\u2003B.\u202f24\u2003\u2003C.\u202f29\u2003\u2003D.\u202f32  \n\n**What to do:**  \n- \u201cAt least one\u201d means **any** student who is in *either* workshop, **including** the ones who are in both.  \n- So you **add** the three relevant groups: only\u202fW\u202f+\u202fonly\u202fX\u202f+\u202fboth.  \n- The \u201cneither\u201d group stays out.\n\nWrite the short calculation you would use and tell me which letter you think is correct. (You can reuse the numbers you already have.)\n\n---\n\n**Give it a try!** \u270d\ufe0f  \n*If you need a hint, just ask \u2013 I\u2019m here to help you keep the \u201cboth\u201d slice straight.*",
