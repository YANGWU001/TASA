It isn\u2019t a step\u2011by\u2011step procedure, a calculator\u2011like tool, or a specific type of error.  \n\nThe correct choice would be **B**: \u201cnoskill is a **concept** that describes a basic idea you need to know before you can solve related problems.\u201d  \n\nDon\u2019t worry \u2013 mixing up categories is common when you\u2019re just getting started. Recognizing the difference is the first step toward mastering the idea.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 reinforcing the definition\n\nSince you\u2019re still building a solid mental picture of what **noskill** means, let\u2019s try another low\u2011difficulty, concept\u2011checking question.\n\n### Question 2\n> Which of the following statements best describes how a **concept** like *noskill* is typically used in mathematics?\n\n| A | B | C | D |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3 \u201cYou apply it directly to compute a numeric answer.\u201d | 2\ufe0f\u20e3 \u201cYou use it to understand why a method works and to decide which method to choose.\u201d | 3\ufe0f\u20e3 \u201cYou memorize it and never need to think about it again.\u201d | 4\ufe0f\u20e3 \u201cIt only matters when you make a mistake.\u201d |\n\n**Please write the letter of the option you think is correct (e.g., **B**).**  \n\nTake a moment, think about the role of a *concept* versus a tool or a procedure, and give it your best shot.  \n\n---\n\n### What we\u2019ll look at next\nYour answer will tell us whether the idea that **noskill** is a *foundation for reasoning* is taking hold. If you still choose a tool\u2011or\u2011procedure answer, we\u2019ll give you another gentle example that links the concept to a concrete situation (e.g., \u201cWhat does the concept of \u2018average\u2019 tell you before you start adding numbers?\u201d).  \n\nKeep it up\u2014you\u2019re making progress with each try! \ud83d\ude80",
