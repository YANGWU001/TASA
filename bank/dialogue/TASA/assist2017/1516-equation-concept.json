Label the point with the exact value you found.\n\n---\n\n**What to show for full credit**\n\n1. **Algebraic steps** \u2013 clearly indicate how you moved the constant term, divided by the coefficient, and arrived at the value of\u202f`x`.\n2. **Verification** \u2013 a short calculation showing that plugging your `x` into `3x + 4` indeed gives\u202f`19`.\n3. **Number\u2011line sketch** \u2013 a short line with a tick mark at the correct location, labeled with the solution (e.g., `x = 5`).  \n\nTake your time, and remember that each step is a chance to reinforce the basic pieces of an equation: **variables, coefficients, constants, and equality**.
