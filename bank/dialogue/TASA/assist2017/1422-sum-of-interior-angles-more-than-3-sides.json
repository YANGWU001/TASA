The only hiccup was a small addition slip\u2014something that\u2019s easy to catch with a quick \u201cpair\u2011up\u201d check (e.g., \\(110+130 = 240\\), then add \\(120\\) \u2192 \\(360\\)).\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fNext practice \u2013 a fresh polygon  \n\nWe\u2019ll keep the same three\u2011step pattern (total\u202f\u2192\u202fadd known\u202f\u2192\u202fsubtract) but with a **convex heptagon** (7 sides).
