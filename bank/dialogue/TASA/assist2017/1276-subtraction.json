The correct arithmetic gives 8.\n\n---\n\n### Next practice \u2013 building confidence with borrowing\n\nLet\u2019s try another subtraction that also needs borrowing, but with a slightly larger number so you can practice the same steps.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{32 \\;-\\; 15 \\;= \\; ?}\n\\]\n\n**What to do**\n\n1. Write the numbers in column form, aligning the tens and ones.  \n2. Start with the ones column. If the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, **borrow 1 ten** from the tens column.  \n3. Show the new numbers after borrowing (you can write a small \u201c\u20111\u201d above the tens column to remind yourself).  \n4. Subtract the ones, then the tens.  \n5.

Borrowing 1 ten turns the ones place into **12** (2\u202f+\u202f10). | \u2705 Perfect! |\n| **Tens column after the borrow:** you noted the tens digit goes from 6 \u2026 | After borrowing one ten, the tens column loses one ten, so **6 becomes 5**. (You didn\u2019t write the \u201c5\u201d yet, but that\u2019s the next number you\u2019ll use.) | \u2705 Exactly the right adjustment. |\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track \u2013 the only thing left is to finish the subtraction for the tens and hundreds columns.\n\n---\n\n## Finish the problem together\n\n1. **Ones:** 12\u202f\u2212\u202f7 = **5** \u2192 write **5** in the ones place.  \n2. **Tens:** now you have **5** tens (because 6 became 5). Since 5\u202f<\u202f8, you need to borrow **1 hundred**.  \n   * Borrowing from the hundreds turns the 4\u202fhundreds into **3**, and the tens become 5\u202f+\u202f10 = **15**.  \n3. **Tens subtraction:** 15\u202f\u2212\u202f8 = **7** \u2192 write **7** in the tens place.  \n4. **Hundreds:** you now have **3** hundreds left, and you\u2019re subtracting the 1\u202fhundred from the bottom number.  \n   3\u202f\u2212\u202f1 = **2** \u2192 write **2** in the hundreds place.  \n\n**Result:**  \n\n```\n   4 6 2\n - 1 8 7\n --------\n   2 7 5\n```\n\nSo **462\u202f\u2212\u202f187 = 275**. Well done\u2014you completed a two\u2011step borrowing problem! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 a fresh three\u2011digit subtraction (still two borrowings, new digits)\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{731 \\;-\\; 459 \\;= \\; ?}\n\\]\n\n### Why this one\n* It\u2019s the same structure you just mastered (three\u2011digit, two borrowings), so the pattern will feel familiar.  \n* The digits are different, giving you extra practice spotting when to borrow.  \n* You\u2019ll finish with a non\u2011zero hundreds digit, which adds a tiny bit of variety.\n\n### Suggested steps (copy the template)\n\n1. **Write the numbers in columns**  \n\n   ```\n     7 3 1\n   \u2011 4 5 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Ones column:** Is 1\u202f<\u202f9? (If yes \u2192 borrow 1 ten.) Write the new ones value and the updated tens digit.  \n\n3. **Subtract the ones.**  \n\n4. **Tens column:** After the first borrow, compare the updated tens digit with 5. (If it\u2019s still smaller \u2192 borrow 1 hundred.) Write the new tens value and the updated hundreds digit.  \n\n5. **Subtract the tens.**  \n\n6. **Hundreds column:** Finish the subtraction with whatever hundreds remain.  \n\n7. **Combine the columns** to get the final answer.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know which step (if any) feels tricky. You\u2019ve already shown you can handle the borrowing process \u2013 I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll nail this one too! \ud83d\ude80",
