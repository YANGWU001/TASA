Write each intermediate step and keep a tally.\n\n3. **State the exponent.**  \n   *Rule:* each left\u2011ward move adds **+1** to the exponent.\n\n4. **Write the final answer** as \\(a \\times 10^{n}\\).\n\n---\n\n### A little scaffold to get you started\n\n| Move # | Decimal position (write the number) | Tally |\n|--------|--------------------------------------|-------|\n| 0 (start) | 56,300. | 0 |\n| 1 | ? | 1 |\n| 2 | ? | 2 |\n| \u2026 | \u2026 | \u2026 |\n\nWhen the number to the left of the decimal point is between 1 and 10, stop and record the exponent.\n\nGive it a try! Post your step\u2011by\u2011step work (you can fill in the table) and I\u2019ll let you know how you did. \ud83c\udf1f\n\n*If you get stuck, just let me know which step is confusing and I\u2019ll give you a gentle hint.*",
