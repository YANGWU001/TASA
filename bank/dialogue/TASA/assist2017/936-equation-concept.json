(You just need to write the result.) |\n\n**What comes next?**  \n\nNow the equation looks like  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{12}x - 5 = 1 .\n\\]\n\n1. **Move the constant** \u2013 add\u202f5 to both sides: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{12}x = 6\\).  \n2. **Isolate \\(x\\)** \u2013 multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\) (i.e., by\u202f12):  \n\n\\[\nx = 6 \\times 12 = 72 .\n\\]\n\n**Check** (optional but good habit):\n\n\\[\n\\frac34(72)-5 = 54-5 = 49,\\qquad\n\\frac23(72)+1 = 48+1 = 49 .\n\\]\n\nBoth sides match, so \\(x = 72\\) is the correct solution. Great work\u2014your fraction handling is solid!\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice (just a little bit harder)\n\nNow let\u2019s add a second fraction on the **right\u2011hand side** and a different constant, so you\u2019ll practice moving terms in both directions.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\frac{5}{8}x \\;+\\; 3 \\;=\\; \\frac{7}{12}x \\;-\\; 4}\n\\]\n\n### Scaffolding hints\n\n1. **Collect the \\(x\\)-terms** \u2013 subtract the smaller\u2011coefficient term \\(\\frac{7}{12}x\\) from **both** sides.  \n2. **Collect the constants** \u2013 move the \u201c\\(+3\\)\u201d to the right (or the \u201c\\(-4\\)\u201d to the left) by adding/subtracting.  \n3. **Find a common denominator** for the remaining \\(x\\)-coefficients (the LCM of 8 and 12 is 24).  \n4. **Isolate \\(x\\)** \u2013 once you have a single coefficient in front of \\(x\\), multiply by its reciprocal.\n\n### What to write\n\n- Write each step in your own words (you can keep the symbols and add a short phrase like",
