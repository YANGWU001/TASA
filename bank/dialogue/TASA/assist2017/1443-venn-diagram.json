After you have drawn the diagram, answer the following questions **without looking back at the sets** (use only your diagram):\n\n   a. **Intersection** \u2013 List the elements that belong to both\u202f\\(A\\) and\u202f\\(B\\).  \n\n   b. **Union** \u2013 How many distinct elements are there in the union \\(A \\cup B\\)?
