So the sum you got is **\\(141^\\circ\\)**. | \u2705 | The column\u2011addition is spot\u2011on. 62\u202f+\u202f79 really equals 141\u202f\u00b0. |\n| **Subtract from 180\u00b0** | \\(180^\\circ - 141^\\circ = 39^\\circ\\) | \u2705 | With the correct sum, the subtraction is also correct. |\n| **Quick check** | \\(62^\\circ + 79^\\circ + 39^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\) | \u2705 | The three angles add to exactly 180\u00b0, confirming the answer. |\n| **Answer choice** | **B)\u202f\\(39^\\circ\\)** | \u2705 | That matches the computed third angle. |\n\n**Great job!** You kept the carry in mind, performed the subtraction cleanly, and used the \u201cquick\u2011check\u201d as a safety net. That habit will keep you from hidden mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 **carry + a tiny twist (using a supplementary\u2011angle idea)**  \n\nA triangle \\( \\triangle PQR \\) has two interior angles:\n\n- \\(\\angle P = 48^\\circ\\)  \n- \\(\\angle Q = 73^\\circ\\)\n\n**What is the measure of the third interior angle \\(\\angle R\\)?**\n\n**Answer choices**\n\nA) \\(57^\\circ\\)\u2003\u2003B) **\\(59^\\circ\\)**\u2003\u2003C) \\(61^\\circ\\)\u2003\u2003D) \\(63^\\circ\\)\n\n#### How to solve (write each step)\n\n1. **Add the two known angles** using column addition.  \n\n```\n   4 8\n + 7 3\n ----\n```\n\n   - Ones column: \\(8 + 3 = 11\\). Write **1** in the ones place, **carry\u202f1**.\n   - Tens column: \\(4 + 7 = 11\\); add the carry\u202f1 \u2192 **12**.  \n   - The total sum is **\\(121^\\circ\\)**.\n\n2. **Subtract that total from 180\u00b0**.  \n\n\\[\n180^\\circ - 121^\\circ = \\; ?\n\\]\n\n3. **Quick check (optional but highly recommended).**  \nAdd \\(\\angle P\\), \\(\\angle Q\\), and the angle you just found; the total should be **180\u00b0**.\n\n4. **Select the matching letter** from the answer list.\n\n---\n\n### What to focus on while you work\n\n- **Carry again:** The ones\u2011column gave a \u201c11\u201d, so remember to add that extra\u202f1 to the tens column before you write the final tens digit.  \n- **Subtraction:** Once you have the correct sum, the subtraction step is straightforward\u2014just line up the numbers and borrow if needed (here you won\u2019t need to borrow).  \n- **Quick\u2011check:** After you have your third angle, add all three angles together. If the total isn\u2019t 180\u00b0, go back and look for a missed carry or a subtraction slip.\n\nGive it a try, and tell me:\n\n- the sum you obtained in step\u202f1,  \n- the difference you got in step\u202f2,  \n- the answer letter you choose,  \n- (optional) the verification you performed in step\u202f3.\n\nYou\u2019ve mastered the carry; now let\u2019s show it works every time! \ud83c\udf1f",
