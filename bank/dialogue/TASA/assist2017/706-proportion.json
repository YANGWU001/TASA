This will let you focus on the proportion itself before we tackle another decimal division.\n\n> **Problem:** A bakery sells **7 loaves of bread for \\$84**.  \n> If the price per loaf stays the same, how much would **3 loaves** cost?  \n> Write your answer in dollars (no cents needed).\n\n#### Your checklist (the same four steps you already know)\n\n| Step | What to do | Hint |\n|------|------------|------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Write the known ratio** | \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{7\\ \\text{loaves}}{84\\ \\text{dollars}}\\) |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Set up the proportion** with unknown cost \\(p\\) for 3 loaves | Keep \u201cloaves over dollars\u201d order: \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{7}{84}= \\frac{3}{p}\\) |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Cross\u2011multiply** | \\(7p = 3 \\times 84\\) |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3  | **Solve for \\(p\\)** by dividing | Compute \\(3 \\times 84 = 252\\) then \\(p = \\dfrac{252}{7}\\) |\n| 5\ufe0f\u20e3  | **State the answer** | \\(p = \\$36\\) |\n\n#### What to do now  \n\n1. Write the proportion (step\u202f2) on your own.  \n2. Show the cross\u2011multiplication (step\u202f3).  \n3. Finish the division and give the final cost.\n\nIf any step feels shaky\u2014especially the division\u2014just let me know and I\u2019ll walk you through it step\u2011by\u2011step.  \n\nOnce you\u2019re comfortable with this whole\u2011number result, we\u2019ll jump back to a problem that ends with a decimal (like the sketchbook question) so you\u2019ll be fully confident with both kinds of answers.  \n\nYou\u2019ve got this\u2014give it a try! \ud83d\ude80",
