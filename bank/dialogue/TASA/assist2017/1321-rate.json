Dividing by 100 makes the time look *much* shorter than it really is. | Use \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{4.2}{60}\\) (or keep it as a fraction \\(\\frac{42}{600}=\\frac{7}{100}\\)\u202fh). That gives \\(0.07\\)\u202fh, not \\(0.042\\)\u202fh. |\n\n**Correct calculation (quick sketch)**  \n\n1. Convert the minutes:  \n   \\[\n   4.2\\text{\u202fmin}= \\frac{4.2}{60}\\text{\u202fh}=0.07\\text{\u202fh}\n   \\]\n   (or exactly \\(\\frac{7}{100}\\)\u202fh).\n\n2. Distance in kilometres:  \n   \\[\n   d = r \\times t = 6.4\\;\\frac{\\text{km}}{\\text{h}}\\times 0.07\\text{\u202fh}=0.448\\text{\u202fkm}\n   \\]\n\n3. Convert km \u2192\u202fm (1\u202fkm\u202f=\u202f1000\u202fm):  \n   \\[\n   0.448\\text{\u202fkm}\\times 1000 = 448\\text{\u202fm}\n   \\]\n\n**So the bus travels about 448\u202fm**, not the value you\u2019d get from the 0.042\u202fh conversion. The reasoning you used is solid\u2014just remember the 60\u2011minute\u2011per\u2011hour factor!\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 a fresh \u201crate\u201d problem**\n\nYou\u2019ve shown you can:\n\n* spot\u2011check the right formula (distance\u202f=\u202frate\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime or time\u202f=\u202fdistance\u202f\u00f7\u202frate)  \n* keep track of units (km/h \u2194\u202fh, then km \u2194\u202fm)\n\nLet\u2019s reinforce that with a *new* set that mixes both directions and adds a second conversion (seconds \u2194\u202fhours).\n\n---\n\n### Problem\n\n**a)** A delivery robot moves at **5.6\u202fkm/h** for **3.9\u202fminutes**.  \nHow many **metres** does it travel?\n\n**b)** A skateboarder covers **250\u202fm** at a speed of **7.2\u202fkm/h**.  \nHow many **seconds** does the ride take?\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist for you\n\n1. **Convert the given time**  \n   * Part\u202fa: minutes \u2192 hours (divide by **60**).  \n   * Part\u202fb: you can either  \n     - keep the speed in km/h, compute the time in **hours**, then turn hours \u2192 seconds (multiply by 3600), **or**  \n     - first change the speed to **m/s** (multiply km/h by\u202f\\( \\frac{1000}{3600}= \\frac{5}{18}\\)) and work directly in seconds.\n\n2. **Apply the right formula**  \n   * Part\u202fa: distance\u202f=\u202frate\u202f\u00d7\u202ftime \u2192 then km \u2192\u202fm.  \n   * Part\u202fb: time\u202f=\u202fdistance \u00f7 rate.\n\n3. **Round only at the very end** (keep extra digits or use fractions until you finish).\n\nGive it a go, and let me know what you obtain!
