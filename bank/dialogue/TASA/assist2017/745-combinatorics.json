Pick the analysts** | \\(\\displaystyle \\binom{7}{3}=35\\) | Choose any 3 of the 7 analysts. |\n| **2. Pick the copywriters** | \\(\\displaystyle \\binom{5}{2}=10\\) | Choose any 2 of the 5 copywriters. |\n| **3. Form the squad** | \\(35 \\times 10 = 350\\) | Selections are independent \u2192 multiply. |\n| **4. Assign the three roles** | \u2013 | This is the tricky part; break it into cases. |\n|\u2003a) Choose **Team\u202fLead** | 5 ways (any squad member) | No restriction yet. |\n|\u2003b) Choose **Creative\u202fDirector** (must be a copywriter \u2260\u202fTeam\u202fLead) | \u2022 If the Team\u202fLead is a copywriter \u2192 1 remaining copywriter.<br>\u2022 If the Team\u202fLead is an analyst \u2192 2 copywriters are still free. | Two cases because the pool of available copywriters depends on who was chosen as Team\u202fLead. |\n|\u2003c) Choose **Data\u202fSpecialist** (must be an analyst \u2260\u202fany previous role) | \u2022 If the Team\u202fLead was a copywriter: after picking Creative\u202fDirector we still have 3 analysts \u2192 3 choices.<br>\u2022 If the Team\u202fLead was an analyst: one analyst is already taken, so only 2 analysts remain \u2192 2 choices. | Again we split by the earlier choices. |\n| **5. Combine the cases** | \\(\\underbrace{2}_{\\text{Lead is copywriter}} \\times 1 \\times 3 \\;+\\; \\underbrace{3}_{\\text{Lead is analyst}} \\times 2 \\times 2 \\;=\\; 6 + 12 = 18\\) | Total ways to fill the three roles for a **fixed** squad. |\n| **6. Final answer** | \\(350 \\times 18 = 6{,}300\\) | Multiply \u201csquads\u201d by \u201crole\u2011assignments\u201d. |\n\nIf you follow those steps, you\u2019ll get **6\u202f300** distinct outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201cchoose\u2011people\u2011then\u2011assign\u2011roles\u201d (a little different)\n\nNow let\u2019s reinforce the same pattern, but with a new twist that will keep the counting fresh.\n\n> **Problem**  \n> A software company has **11** employees: 6 developers, 3 testers, and",
