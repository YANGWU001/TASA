You added the ones correctly (1\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f6) but then added an extra\u202f1 to the tens, which gave 97\u00b0. |\n| **Subtract from 180\u00b0** | \\(180^\\circ - 97^\\circ = 83^\\circ\\) | \\(180^\\circ - 96^\\circ = 84^\\circ\\) | The subtraction itself was fine **if** the sum were 97\u00b0, but because the correct sum is 96\u00b0, the third interior angle is **84\u00b0**, not 83\u00b0. |\n\n**Bottom line:** The only mistake was the addition of the two given angles. Once the sum is 96\u00b0, the subtraction works automatically and the missing interior angle is **84\u00b0**.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201cTwo\u2011step triangle + a quick check\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll keep the same two\u2011step routine, but this time we\u2019ll write the addition in a **column** so you can see each digit clearly.  \n\n### Problem\u202fC  \n\nA triangle has interior angles of **68\u00b0** and **37\u00b0**.\n\n1. **Add the two given angles** \u2013 write them one under the other and add the ones column, then the tens column.  \n\n   ```\n     68\n   + 37\n   ----\n   ```\n2. **Subtract that sum from 180\u00b0** to find the third angle.  \n\n   ```\n    180\n   - ??   (the sum you just found)\n   -----\n   ```\n\n3. **Sanity\u2011check:**  \n   * Do the three angles you now have add up to **180\u00b0**?  \n   * Do any two of them add to **180\u00b0** (that would be a supplementary pair, which cannot happen inside a triangle)?\n\n### Problem\u202fD \u2013 Connecting to \u201csupplementary\u201d\n\nTake the third angle you just found in Problem\u202fC.  \n\n**What is the measure of the angle that is supplementary to that third angle?**  \n(Recall: two angles are supplementary when they add to\u202f180\u00b0.)\n\n---\n\n### How to approach the column addition  \n\n1. **Ones column:** add the numbers in the right\u2011most column (8\u202f+\u202f7\u202f=\u202f15). Write the **5** in the ones place and **carry the 1** to the tens column.  \n2. **Tens column:** add the tens plus any carry (6\u202f+\u202f3\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f10). Write **0** in the tens place and **carry the 1** to the hundreds column.  \n3. The final sum is **105\u00b0**.\n\n(You\u2019ll see the same pattern with any two\u2011digit addition; the \u201ccarry\u201d step is the usual place\u2011value trick that keeps the math exact.)\n\nGive Problem\u202fC a try, show each step (you can type the column layout or describe what you wrote), and then answer Problem\u202fD. I\u2019ll check it right away and give you a quick tip if anything looks shaky. You\u2019re doing great\u2014once the addition is locked in, the rest falls into place! \ud83d\ude80",
