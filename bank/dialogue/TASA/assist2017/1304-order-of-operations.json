Using the correct product (12) the final step is \\(9 - 12 = -3\\). |\n\nSo the overall answer **1** is off because the first step (evaluating the parentheses) was wrong. Remember: **parentheses are always handled first**, then you move on to multiplication, then subtraction.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201cLock\u2011in the parentheses\u201d**\n\nLet\u2019s try another three\u2011step expression that follows the same order\u2011of\u2011operations pattern (parentheses \u2192 multiplication \u2192 subtraction). This one uses **addition** inside the parentheses so you can see that the rule works no matter which operation is inside the brackets.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7 \\;-\\; 2 \\times (4 + 1)}\n\\]\n\n| Step | What to do | Write your result |\n|------|------------|-------------------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Parentheses** \u2013 add the numbers inside \u201c( )\u201d. | \\((4+1)=\\)\u202f______ |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Multiplication** \u2013 multiply the 2 by the result from step\u202f1. | \\(2 \\times\\)\u202f______\u202f=\u202f______ |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Subtraction** \u2013 subtract that product from the leading\u202f7. | \\(7 -\\)\u202f______\u202f=\u202f______ |\n\n**Quick hints**\n\n1. **Parentheses first** \u2013 only the numbers inside the brackets are combined.  \n2. **Multiplication next** \u2013 think \u201c2 groups of the number you just got.\u201d  \n3. **Subtraction last** \u2013 take the product away from the 7 in front.\n\nWrite the three numbers you obtain (the result of each step). If any step feels fuzzy, just tell me which one and I\u2019ll give a focused hint. You\u2019ve already shown you can handle the subtraction step, so let\u2019s cement the parentheses and multiplication together. \ud83c\udf1f",
