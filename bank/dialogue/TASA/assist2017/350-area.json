Write the area formula.  \n2. Substitute the numbers (show the product as a multiplication).  \n3. **Do the repeated\u2011addition twice** (add the 5\u2019s two times *and* add the 2\u2019s five times).  \n4. Draw (or imagine) a tiny 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 grid of 1\u2011m squares and count the squares to verify your answer.\n\n### Scaffolding checklist\n\n| Step | What to do | Example for the rug |\n|------|------------|---------------------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3 | State the formula | \\(A = \\text{length}\\times\\text{width}\\) |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3 | Plug in the numbers | \\(A = 2 \\times 5\\) |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3 | Repeated\u2011addition (both ways) | \\(2\\times5 = 5+5 = 10\\) **or** \\(2\\times5 = 2+2+2+2+2 = 10\\) |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3 | Attach the unit | \\(10\\;\\text{m}^2\\) |\n| 5\ufe0f\u20e3 | (Optional) Sketch a 2\u2011by\u20115 grid and count the 10 little squares. | \u2714\ufe0f |\n\n**What to send back**\n\n- The final area you obtain.  \n- The first repeated\u2011addition you tried (e.g., \u201c5\u202f+\u202f5\u201d) and then the second one (e.g., \u201c2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f+\u202f2\u201d).  \n- If you drew the grid, how many little squares you counted.\n\nIf any step feels fuzzy\u2014especially deciding which number to add how many times\u2014just let me know and we\u2019ll walk through it together, maybe with a quick doodle on paper or a mental picture of rows and columns. You\u2019re doing great; the more you practice the \u201crows\u202f\u00d7\u202fcolumns\u201d picture, the more automatic it will become! \ud83c\udf1f",
