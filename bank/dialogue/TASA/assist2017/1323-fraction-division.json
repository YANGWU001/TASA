Fill in **just the parts you\u2019re ready to answer**; you can stop after any step and I\u2019ll help you move on.\n\n---\n\n### Step\u202f1 \u2013 Flip the divisor  \nWhat is the reciprocal of \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{3}{14}\\)?\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle\\frac{14}{3}}\n\\]\n\n*(If you\u2019re unsure, remember \u201creciprocal = swap numerator and denominator.\u201d)*  \n\n---\n\n### Step\u202f2 \u2013 Prime\u2011factor lists  \n\nWrite the prime\u2011factor decomposition for each number that will appear in the product  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{28}\\times\\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\n| Number | Prime\u2011factor list (fill in) |\n|--------|-----------------------------|\n| 9      | **______** |\n| 28     | **______** |\n| 14     | **______** |\n| 3      | **______** |\n\n*Hints:*  \n- \\(9 = 3 \\times 3\\)  \n- \\(28 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 7\\)  \n- \\(14 = 2 \\times 7\\)  \n- \\(3 = 3\\)\n\n---\n\n### What to do now  \n\n1. **Write the reciprocal** (Step\u202f1).  \n2. **List the prime factors** for the four numbers (Step\u202f2).  \n\nYou can paste just the reciprocal, or the reciprocal **plus** any factor lists you feel confident about. If you get stuck on a particular number, let me know which one and I\u2019ll give a quick hint.\n\nYou\u2019ve already proved you can cancel correctly, so once the factors are on the page the cancellations will fall into place.
