One more move (move\u202f6) gives **9.87**, which finally satisfies \\(1 \\le a < 10\\).\n\nBecause you moved the decimal **right**, the exponent is **negative**, and its absolute value equals the number of moves:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0.00000987 = 9.87 \\times 10^{-6}}\n\\]\n\nSo the correct answer is \\(a = 9.87\\) and \\(n = -6\\).\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fNext practice \u2013 \u201ccount the moves\u201d in both directions  \n\nYou\u2019ve shown you can count moves for a small number; now let\u2019s reinforce that skill with **two new numbers**\u2014one tiny, one huge.  \n\n#### Problem\u202fC (tiny number)  \nConvert  \n\n\\[\n0.00321\n\\]\n\nto scientific notation \\(a \\times 10^{n}\\) with \\(1 \\le a < 10\\).\n\n#### Problem\u202fD (large number)  \nConvert  \n\n\\[\n5\\,600\\,000\n\\]\n\nto scientific notation \\(a \\times 10^{n}\\) with \\(1 \\le a < 10\\).\n\n#### How to solve (quick reminder)\n\n1.
