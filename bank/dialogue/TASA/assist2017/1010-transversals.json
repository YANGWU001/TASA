That\u2019s completely fine\u2014recognizing that a concept is tricky is the first step toward mastering it.  \n\nHere\u2019s a quick reminder of the three angle relationships that **always** hold when a transversal cuts two *parallel* lines:\n\n| Relationship | How the angles sit | What they do |\n|--------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **Corresponding** | Same corner of each intersection (e.g., the upper\u2011right angle at \u2113\u2081 and the upper\u2011right angle at \u2113\u2082) | **Equal** |\n| **Alternate interior** | Inside the two lines but on opposite sides of the transversal | **Equal** |\n| **Consecutive (same\u2011side interior)** | Inside the two lines and on the same side of the transversal | **Supplementary** (add to\u202f180\u00b0) |\n\nLooking back at the four answer choices:\n\n- **A)** \u2220A and \u2220B are the two angles that share a side of the transversal at the *same* line \u2113\u2081. They are **adjacent** and together make 180\u00b0, not equal.  \n- **B)** \u2220A and the angle on \u2113\u2082 that sits in the same \u201ccorner\u201d as \u2220A are a pair of **corresponding angles** \u2013 they are always equal when \u2113\u2081 \u2225 \u2113\u2082.  \n- **C)** \u2220A and the angle directly across from it on the same line \u2113\u2081 are a **linear pair**; they are supplementary, but the wording \u201cdirectly across on the same line\u201d is a bit ambiguous.  \n- **D)** \u201cNone of the above\u201d is false because B is correct.\n\n**So the correct answer is B.**  \n\n---\n\n### Next practice \u2013\u202fbuilding on what you just reviewed\n\nBecause you\u2019re still solidifying the basic relationships, this next problem gives you a little more scaffolding (a diagram description and a hint).
