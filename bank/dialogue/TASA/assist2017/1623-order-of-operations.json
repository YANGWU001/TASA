When you\u2019re done, tell me the final answer and the numbers you found in each step.  \n\nIf any step feels fuzzy\u2014especially the left\u2011to\u2011right rule for the division\u2011then\u2011multiplication\u2014let me know exactly where, and I\u2019ll walk through that piece with you. You\u2019ve already shown you can keep the parentheses and the left\u2011to\u2011right rule straight; this problem will give you another solid rehearsal. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nGive it a try, and remember: one small step at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this!",
