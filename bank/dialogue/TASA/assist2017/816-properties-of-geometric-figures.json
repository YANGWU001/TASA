In those cases the side lengths are **not** all the same, so the statement \u201call four sides are equal\u201d is **false** for most rectangles. |\n| *Your symbols* | The chain of equalities you wrote correctly expresses \u201call four sides have the same length,\u201d but the geometric fact you are trying to describe does **not** hold for every rectangle. |\n\n**What *is* always true for every rectangle**\n\n1. **Opposite sides are parallel (and therefore equal).**  \n   \\[\n   AB \\parallel CD \\;\\wedge\\; AD \\parallel BC\n   \\]\n2. **Every interior angle is a right angle.**  \n   \\[\n   AB \\perp AD \\quad\\text{(equivalently } \\angle A = 90^{\\circ}\\text{).}\n   \\]\n\nA compact symbolic description that captures *all* rectangle properties can be any of the following equivalent forms:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{AB \\parallel CD \\;\\wedge\\; AD \\parallel BC \\;\\wedge\\; AB \\perp AD}\n\\]\n\nor  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{AB = CD \\;\\wedge\\; BC = AD \\;\\wedge\\; \\angle A = 90^{\\circ}}\n\\]\n\nYou already know how to write the symbols \u2013 the next step is to attach them to the **right** geometric relationships. Great effort so far! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fNext practice \u2013 \u201cmust\u2011be\u201d facts of a rectangle  \n\nBelow are the same four statements about a quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\). **Select the one that is true for **every** rectangle** and then translate it into symbols.  \n\n| Choice | Statement |\n|--------|-----------|\n| **A** | Opposite sides are equal in length, and each interior angle is a right angle. |\n| **B** | All four sides are equal in length. |\n| **C** | Only one pair of opposite sides is parallel. |\n| **D** | The diagonals are perpendicular. |\n\n#### Your task (in two short steps)\n\n1. **Write the letter** of the correct choice (A,\u202fB,\u202fC, or\u202fD).  \n2. **Write a symbolic version** of that property using only the symbols \\(\\parallel,\\;\\perp,\\;=\\) and the connective \\(\\wedge\\).  \n   *You may choose any equivalent form you like; a couple of examples are given for guidance.*\n\n**Examples of acceptable symbolic forms**  \n\n- \\(AB \\parallel CD \\;\\wedge\\; AD \\parallel BC \\;\\wedge\\; AB \\perp AD\\)  \n- \\(AB = CD \\;\\wedge\\; BC = AD \\;\\wedge\\; \\angle A = 90^{\\circ}\\)\n\n**A tiny hint**\n\nThink again of the \u201csmallest\u201d rectangle you can draw: two long sides, two short sides, and four right\u2011angle corners. Which relationships **cannot** change no matter how you stretch or shrink the shape? That is the statement that will be true for *every* rectangle.\n\nGive it a go\u2014remember, you already know the symbols; now we just need to pair them with the correct geometric fact. I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll nail it! \ud83d\ude80",
