Your 124.3 is only a 0.2\u2011unit rounding error \u2013 still acceptable. |\n| **Square\u2011root & rounding** | \\(\\sqrt{37.7}\\approx6.1\\text{\u202fcm}\\) | \u26a0\ufe0f Almost there | \\(\\sqrt{37.7}=6.156\\ldots\\) which rounds to **6.2\u202fcm** (one\u2011decimal place). So the base is **6.2\u202fcm**, not 6.1\u202fcm. |\n| **Scale factor (9\u202f\u2192\u202f5)** | \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{5}{9}\\approx0.56\\) | \u2705 | Correct direction and value (5\u202f\u00f7\u202f9\u202f\u2248\u202f0.556, rounded to 0.56). |\n| **Predicted base** | \\(6.1\\text{\u202fcm}\\times0.56\\approx3.4\\text{\u202fcm}\\) | \u2705 (conceptually) | You applied the factor correctly. Using the more accurate base (6.2\u202fcm) gives \\(6.2\\times0.556\\approx3.45\\)\u202fcm, which rounds to **3.5\u202fcm**. That is essentially the same as the 3.4\u202fcm you obtained, confirming the scaling rule works. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYour reasoning, set\u2011up, and scaling are spot\u2011on. The only tweak needed is the final rounding of the base (6.2\u202fcm) and, consequently, the predicted base (\u2248\u202f3.5\u202fcm). Great job tying the two methods together!\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 \u201cScale\u202f+\u202fCosine\u201d combo  \n\nNow we\u2019ll stretch the pattern\u2011finding skill a bit more. You\u2019ll work with a **different vertex angle**, compute the base with the Law of Cosines, then use similarity to predict the base of a smaller triangle *without* doing another cosine calculation.\n\n> **Problem**  \n> An isosceles triangle has a vertex angle of **",
