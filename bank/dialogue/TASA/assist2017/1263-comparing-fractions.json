Since \\(9/24 > 8/24\\), the fraction \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{3}{8}\\) is the larger one.\n\n* Your intuition that \u201ca smaller denominator means a larger fraction\u201d works **only when the numerators are the same** (e.g., \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) vs. \\(\\frac{2}{7}\\)). In this problem the numerators are different (3 vs.\u202f1), so the rule does not apply.\n\nGreat effort, though! Spotting the denominator clue shows you\u2019re thinking about the right ideas.
