That\u2019s exactly the right expression. |\n| **b** | \\(C = 0.75(8) + 2.50 = 5 + 2.50 = 7.50\\) | \u274c | The product \\(0.75 \\times 8\\) is **6.00**, not 5 (or 6).  \\(\\;0.75 \\times 8 = \\frac{3}{4}\\times 8 = 6\\).  So the total cost is \\(6 + 2.50 = 8.50\\). |\n| **c** | You started \u201c\\(0.\\)\u201d and stopped. | \u274c | The idea is right: set the expression equal to the amount paid and solve for \\(x\\).  Let\u2019s finish it together. |\n\n---\n\n### Finishing Part\u202fc together  \n\nWe know the customer paid \\$8.00, so  \n\n\\[\n0.75x + 2.50 = 8.00\n\\]\n\n1. **Subtract the delivery fee**  \n   \\[\n   0.75x = 8.00 - 2.50 = 5.50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide by the cost per cupcake**  \n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{5.50}{0.75} = \\frac{55}{7.5} = \\frac{22}{3} \\approx 7.33\n   \\]\n\nSo mathematically the solution is \\(x = \\dfrac{22}{3}\\) (about 7\u202f\u2153 cupcakes).  \nSince you can\u2019t buy a fraction of a cupcake, the realistic interpretation is that the customer bought **7 cupcakes** and paid a little extra (perhaps for a larger size or an extra topping).  \n\nGreat effort \u2013 you\u2019ve got the right set\u2011up; we just needed to be careful with the multiplication and the final division.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc49 Next practice \u2013 building on what you just did\n\nLet\u2019s try a very similar problem, but this time the numbers work out to a whole\u2011number answer.
