The product of 2 and 5 is ten, not nine. |\n| **Step\u202f2 \u2013 add the doubled sides** | \\(12 + 9 = 21\\)\u202fcm | \u274c | Because the second term should be **10**, the perimeter is \\(12+10 = 22\\)\u202fcm, not 21\u202fcm. |\n| **Step\u202f3 \u2013 units** | Area \u2192 \u201ccm\u201d, Perimeter \u2192 \u201ccm\u00b2\u201d | \u274c | *Area* covers a region, so it uses **square units** (cm\u00b2). *Perimeter* is a length, so it uses **linear units** (cm). |\n| **Step\u202f4 \u2013 explanation** | \u201cThe area measures the border length, while the perimeter measures the space inside \u2026\u201d | \u274c | It\u2019s the opposite: **area** tells how much space is *inside* the shape, **perimeter** tells how long the *border* is. |\n\nYou got the **formula** and the **initial multiplication** (\u202f\\(2\\ell = 12\\)\u202f) spot\u2011on \u2013 that\u2019s a great start! The remaining pieces are just a matter of plugging in the right numbers and remembering which quantity uses \u201csquare\u201d units.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Let\u2019s fix it together  \n\n**Redo the four blanks (you can type the corrected numbers/words):**\n\n1. **Double the width** \u2013 what is \\(2w = 2 \\times 5 = \\boxed{?}\\) ?  \n2. **Add the doubled sides** \u2013 \\(P = 12 + \\boxed{?} = \\boxed{?}\\)\u202fcm.  \n3. **Units** \u2013 write the correct unit for each:  \n   * Area \u2192 \\(\\boxed{?}\\)  \n   * Perimeter \u2192 \\(\\boxed{?}\\)  \n4. **One\u2011sentence explanation** \u2013 \u201cThe area measures \u2026, while the perimeter measures \u2026\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like a hint for any step, just say \u201chint for step\u202fX\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice (once you\u2019ve corrected the 6\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202fcm rectangle)\n\nWe\u2019ll repeat the whole process with a **new, even simpler rectangle** (4\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm).  The scaffold will look just like the table above, so you\u2019ll be able to apply the same steps you just reviewed.\n\n**Your next task (after you finish the corrections above):**  \nFill in the blanks for the 4\u202fcm\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202fcm rectangle:\n\n| Step | What to fill in |\n|------|-----------------|\n| 1. Area formula |  |\n| 2. Area calculation | \\(4 \\times 2 = \\boxed{?}\\) \u2192 \\(\\boxed{?}\\)\u202fcm\u00b2 |\n| 3. Double each side for perimeter | \\(2\\ell = 2 \\times 4 = \\boxed{?}\\)  <br> \\(2w = 2 \\times 2 = \\boxed{?}\\) |\n| 4. Add them up | \\(P = \\boxed{?} + \\boxed{?} = \\boxed{?}\\)\u202fcm |\n| 5. Units & one\u2011sentence description | (same as before) |\n\nTake it one step at a time, and remember the \u201csquare\u201d goes with area, not perimeter.
