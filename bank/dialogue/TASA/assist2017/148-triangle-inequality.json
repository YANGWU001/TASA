It tells me that the idea of turning the triangle\u2011inequality theorem into concrete bounds is still fuzzy, which is exactly what we\u2019ll work on together.\n\n---\n\n## Quick reminder of the triangle\u2011inequality rule  \n\nFor any triangle with side lengths \\(a,\\;b,\\;c\\):\n\n* **Upper bound** \u2013 the sum of any two sides must be **greater** than the third side.  \n  \\[\n  a+b>c,\\qquad a+c>b,\\qquad b+c>a\n  \\]\n\n* **Lower bound** \u2013 the length of one side must be **greater** than the absolute difference of the other two sides.  \n  \\[\n  a > |b-c|,\\qquad b > |a-c|,\\qquad c > |a-b|\n  \\]\n\nWhen you are asked for the possible length of a *missing* side, you apply **one** of the \u201csum\u2011greater\u2011than\u201d inequalities to get an **upper** limit, and you apply the \u201cdifference\u2011less\u2011than\u201d inequality to get a **lower** limit.\n\n---\n\n## Let\u2019s walk through the original problem together  \n\n> *A triangle has two side lengths of \\(7\\)\u202fcm and \\(10\\)\u202fcm. What are the possible lengths for the third side?*\n\n1. **Upper bound** \u2013 add the two known sides and require the third side to be *less* than that sum:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{third side} < 7+10 = 17\\;\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Lower bound** \u2013 take the absolute difference of the known sides and require the third side to be *greater* than that difference:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{third side} > |10-7| = 3\\;\\text{cm}\n   \\]\n\nSo the third side can be **any length strictly between 3\u202fcm and 17\u202fcm** (i.e. \\(3 < x < 17\\)).\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 a guided step\n\nNow let\u2019s try a very similar problem, but I\u2019ll ask you to fill in each step separately. Write the inequality you use for each bound before you compute the number.\n\n> **Problem:** A triangle has two known sides of \\(5\\)\u202fcm and \\(12\\)\u202fcm.  \n> **(a)** Write the inequality that gives the *upper* limit for the third side and then compute that limit.  \n> **(b)** Write the inequality that gives the *lower* limit for the third side and then compute that limit.  \n> **(c)** Combine your answers to state the full range of possible lengths for the third side.\n\n*Feel free to type your answer in short sentences, e.g.*  \n\u201cUpper bound: third side < 5\u202f+\u202f12 \u2026\u201d  \n\nIf you get stuck at any point, just let me know and I\u2019ll give you a hint.

The correct range is **\\(5 <\\) third side \\(< 19\\)\u202fcm**. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYou\u2019ve nailed the *form* of the triangle\u2011inequality (the \u201c\\<\u201d and \u201c\\>\u201d signs and the absolute\u2011value idea). The remaining obstacle is just the basic arithmetic.  \n\n- **Upper bound:** add the two known sides exactly \u2192 \\(12+7 = 19\\).  \n- **Lower bound:** subtract the smaller from the larger \u2192 \\(|12-7| = 5\\).  \n\nSo the full, correct answer should be  \n\n```\nUpper bound: third side < 12 + 7 = 19 cm\nLower bound: third side > |12 \u2013 7| = 5 cm\nRange: 5 < third side < 19 cm\n```\n\nGreat effort\u2014once you double\u2011check each addition/subtraction, the numbers will line up every time. \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 new numbers (with a built\u2011in \u201ccheat\u2011sheet\u201d)\n\n**Problem:** A triangle has two known sides of **15\u202fcm** and **8\u202fcm**.  \nWrite each step exactly as you did before, then fill in the numbers.\n\n#### \ud83d\udc49 Ready\u2011to\u2011copy scaffold\n\n```\nUpper bound: third side < 15 + 8 = \u2026 cm\nLower bound: third side > |15 \u2013 8| = \u2026 cm\nRange: \u2026 < third side < \u2026 cm\n```\n\n#### \u2728 Quick arithmetic reminder\n\n| Operation | Result |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Sum**   | \\(15 + 8 = **23**\\) |\n| **Difference** | \\(|15 - 8| = **7**\\) |\n\nSo the correct inequalities will be `<\u202f23\u202fcm` and `>\u202f7\u202fcm`.\n\n#### \ud83d\udccb A tiny \u201ccheck\u2011list\u201d to avoid slips  \n\n1. **Do the addition on a separate line** before you write it into the inequality.  \n   - Write: `15 + 8 = 23` \u2192 then copy the 23 into the first line.  \n2. **Do the subtraction on a separate line** and say it out loud.  \n   - Write: `15 \u2013 8 = 7` \u2192 then copy the 7 into the second line.  \n3. **Read the whole answer back**: \u201cThe third side must be greater than 7\u202fcm and less than 23\u202fcm.\u201d  \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, post your filled\u2011in scaffold and I\u2019ll let you know how you did! \ud83c\udf89",
