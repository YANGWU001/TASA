The correct answer is **17.5\u202fkg of sugar**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 a fresh proportion (keep the whole\u2011number answer)\n\n> **Problem:** A garden needs **8\u202fL of water** to irrigate **4\u202fm\u00b2** of soil.  \n> If you have a plot that is **27\u202fm\u00b2**, how many litres of water are required?\n\n#### What to do (choose one method)\n\n1. **Write the proportion**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{8\\ \\text{L}}{4\\ \\text{m}^2}= \\frac{w\\ \\text{L}}{27\\ \\text{m}^2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve** \u2013 either  \n   * **Rate\u2011first:** compute the exact rate \\(8 \u00f7 4 = 2\\)\u202fL\u202f/\u202fm\u00b2, then multiply by 27.  \n   * **Cross\u2011multiply:** \\(8 \\times 27 = 4 \\times w\\) \u2192 solve for \\(w\\).\n\n3. **Check** (optional): plug your answer back into the ratio to see if it equals the original rate.\n\nGive it a try and tell me:\n\n* the number you obtain, **and**  \n* which method you used (rate\u2011first or cross\u2011multiply).\n\nIf any step feels fuzzy, just write down where you\u2019re stuck and we\u2019ll sort it out together. You\u2019ve got the set\u2011up down\u2014now let\u2019s lock in the calculation! \ud83c\udf1f",
