      "content": "**What your last reply means**  \nSaying \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to answer this\u201d isn\u2019t a mistake at all. It tells me that you grasp the *big picture* \u2013 you know you have to turn the division into multiplication and look for a factor to cancel \u2013 but you\u2019re still deciding **which numbers to cancel first**. That\u2019s exactly the skill we\u2019re practising right now, so let\u2019s try another problem where the best cancellation is obvious.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Practice: \u201cpick\u2011one\u2011cancellation\u201d  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\frac{6}{14}\\; \\div\\; \\frac{9}{21}}\n\\]\n\n### Fill\u2011in\u2011the\u2011blanks  \n\n1. **Write the division as multiplication by the reciprocal**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6}{14}\\;\\times\\;\\underline{\\displaystyle \\frac{?}{?}}\n   \\]\n\n   *Hint:* The reciprocal of \\(\\frac{9}{21}\\) is \\(\\frac{21}{9}\\).\n\n2. **Choose **ONE** common factor to cancel before you multiply**  \n\n   Look at the four numbers you now have: **6,\u202f14,\u202f21,\u202f9**.  \n   - **Option\u202fA:** 6 and 9 share a factor of **3**.  \n   - **Option\u202fB:** 14 and 21 share a factor of **7**.  \n\n   Write which factor you will cancel (e.g., \u201ccancel\u202f3\u201d) and cross it out.\n\n3. **Write the reduced fractions after that cancellation**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\;a\\;}{\\;b\\;}\\;\\times\\;\\frac{\\;c\\;}{\\;d\\;}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Multiply the remaining numerators and denominators**  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\;a\\!\\times\\!c\\;}{\\;b\\!\\times\\!d\\;}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the final fraction (if needed)** and give your answer in lowest terms.\n\n---\n\n### What to do next  \n\n1. Fill in blank\u202f1 with the reciprocal \\(\\frac{21}{9}\\).  \n2. Pick **one** of the two cancellation options (A or B) and write it in step\u202f2.  \n3. Carry the reduced numbers through steps\u202f3\u20115.\n\nIf you get stuck on any particular step, just tell me \u201cI\u2019m stuck on step\u202f2\u201d (or the step you\u2019re unsure about) and I\u2019ll walk you through it. You\u2019re doing great\u2014let\u2019s finish this one together! \ud83d\ude80",
