Use the triangle\u2011inequality theorem to decide whether a triangle with these side lengths can exist.  \n2. Write \u201cYes\u201d if it can, or \u201cNo\u201d if it cannot. (You don\u2019t need to draw the triangle.)\n\n*Recall:* For three lengths \\(a, b, c\\) to be the sides of a triangle, **all three** of the following must be true  \n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na + b &> c \\\\\na + c &> b \\\\\nb + c &> a\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Expected Answer (for you to check later)\n\n1. Check each inequality:  \n\n   * \\(4 + 9 = 13 > 6\\)\u2003\u2713  \n   * \\(4 + 6 = 10 > 9\\)\u2003\u2713  \n   * \\(9 + 6 = 15 > 4\\)\u2003\u2713  \n\n2. All three conditions are satisfied, so the answer is **\u201cYes.\u201d**  \n\nIf you answered \u201cNo,\u201d look back at the three sums above and see which one (if any) fails the \u201cgreater than\u201d test.

Since \\(10\\) **is** larger than \\(9\\) ( \\(10 > 9\\) ), this inequality also holds.  \n\nBecause **all three** inequalities are true, the three lengths **can** be the sides of a triangle.  So the correct answer is **\u201cYes.\u201d**  \n\nYour reasoning was on the right track\u2014you remembered to test each pair\u2014but a quick double\u2011check of the arithmetic shows that the second inequality is satisfied as well.

Write \u201cYes\u201d if **all three** are true, or \u201cNo\u201d if **any** one (or more) is false.\n\n### Hint  \n\n- Compute each sum first (e.g., \\(a+b = 5+12 = 17\\)).  \n- Then compare the sum to the third side (is \\(17 > 7\\)?).  \n- Do the same for the other two pairs.  \n- Remember: **one failure is enough to answer \u201cNo.\u201d**\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get!",

Because the sum is off, any inequality that uses this value will also be wrong. No worries \u2013 it\u2019s a simple arithmetic slip, and catching it now will keep the rest of the triangle\u2011inequality work on solid footing.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Let\u2019s finish the table together**\n\nBelow is the same table with a few prompts. Fill in the blanks, and I\u2019ll let you know how you did.\n\n| Step | What to do | Write your answer |\n|------|------------|-------------------|\n| **1** | Compute the three sums \\(a+b,\\; a+c,\\; b+c\\). | \u2022 \\(a+b = 6+2 = \\) **8**  <br>\u2022 \\(a+c = 6+7 = \\) **13**  <br>\u2022 \\(b+c = 2+7 = \\) **9** |\n| **2** | Write each inequality \\(a+b>c,\\; a+c>b,\\; b+c>a\\) and mark **True** or **False**. | \u2022 \\(a+b > c\\)\u2003\\(8 > 7\\) \u2192 **True**  <br>\u2022 \\(a+c > b\\)\u2003\\(13 > 2\\) \u2192 **True**  <br>\u2022 \\(b+c > a\\)\u2003\\(9 > 6\\) \u2192 **True** |\n| **3** | Give the **final answer** \u2013 \u201cYes\u201d if *all* three are true, otherwise \u201cNo.\u201d | **Yes** |\n| **4** *(optional)* | Identify **which** inequality is false (if any) and explain in one sentence why. | *All three are true, so none are false.* |\n\n> **Take a moment** to write your answers in the table (you can copy the format above) and send them back. I\u2019ll check them and give you a quick tip before we move on.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 a \u201ctricky\u201d case\n\nNow we\u2019ll work on a problem where **two** of the three inequalities fail. This will help you see how a single false statement already makes the overall answer \u201cNo,\u201d and how multiple false statements reinforce that rule.\n\n\\[\na = 4,\\qquad b = 5,\\qquad c = 9.\n\\]\n\n#### Your new table\n\n| Step | What to do | Write your answer |\n|------|------------|-------------------|\n| **1** | Compute the three sums \\(a+b,\\; a+c,\\; b+c\\). |  |\n| **2** | Write each inequality \\(a+b>c,\\; a+c>b,\\; b+c>a\\) and mark **True** or **False**. |  |\n| **3** | Final answer \u2013 \u201cYes\u201d if *all* are true, otherwise \u201cNo.\u201d |  |\n| **4** *(optional)* | Which inequality(s) are false? Explain in one sentence each. |  |\n\n#### Hints (use them one at a time)\n\n1. **Smallest pair first:** \\(a+b = 4+5 = 9\\). Compare to \\(c = 9\\).  \n2. **Next pair:** \\(a+c = 4+9 = 13\\). Compare to \\(b = 5\\).  \n3. **Largest pair:** \\(b+c = 5+9 = 14\\). Compare to \\(a = 4\\).  \n\nRemember, the sign is **strictly \u201c>\u201d**. If you get equality (like \\(9 = 9\\)), that counts as **False**.\n\n---\n\nGive the new table a try, and let me know what you get.
