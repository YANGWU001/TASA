Decimal** | \\( \\displaystyle \\frac{7}{8}= 7 \\div 8 = 0.875\\) | \u2705\u202fCorrect \u2013 the long\u2011division gives the terminating decimal **0.875**. |\n| **b. Percent** | *not filled yet* | \u2753\u202fWe expect you to multiply the decimal by\u202f100 (or move the decimal point two places right). \\(0.875 \\times 100 = 87.5\\%\\). |\n| **c. Equivalent\u202f+\u202fsimplify** | *not filled yet* | \u2753\u202fThe steps are:  <br>1\ufe0f\u20e3 Find the factor that turns the original denominator\u202f8 into the new denominator\u202f32.  \\(8 \\times 4 = 32\\) \u2192 factor = **4**. <br>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Multiply numerator and denominator by\u202f4: \\(\\frac{7\\times4}{8\\times4}= \\frac{28}{32}\\). <br>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Reduce \\(\\frac{28}{32}\\) by its GCD (which is\u202f4): \\(\\frac{28\\div4}{32\\div4}= \\frac{7}{8}\\). <br>So the final simplest form is **\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{7}{8}\\)** (the same as we started, which is a good check). |\n\n**What to do next**\n\n1. Complete **b** by writing the percent (hint: move the decimal two places right).  \n2. Complete **c** using the three sub\u2011steps shown above, and fill in the blanks in the table.\n\nYou\u2019re already solid on the decimal conversion; the remaining steps just need a quick \u201cmultiply\u2011by\u2011100\u201d and a little GCD reduction.

Decimal** | Perform \\(5 \u00f7 6\\). It will give a repeating decimal; write it to three decimal places (e.g., 0.833\u2026). |\n| **b. Percent** | Multiply the decimal by\u202f100 (or slide the decimal point two places right). |\n| **c. Equivalent\u202f+\u202fsimplify** | 1\ufe0f\u20e3 What number times 6 gives 30? (Answer: 5). 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Multiply top\u202f&\u202fbottom by that number. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Find the GCD of the new numerator and denominator and divide both by it. |\n\n#### Your workspace (copy, fill in, and send back)\n\n| Step | Work you do (fill the blanks",
