Convert the mixed number** | \u2705 \u202f\\(3\\frac34 = \\dfrac{15}{4}\\) \u2013 you multiplied \\(3\\times4\\) and added the\u202f\\(\\frac34\\). Perfect! | \u2013 |\n| **b. Write the proportion** | \u274c \u202fYou wrote \u201c\\((15/4)/6 = o/19\\)\u201d.  The left\u2011hand side should be a *single* fraction that represents \u201ccups per serving\u201d.  Either of these is fine:  <br>\u202f\u202f\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{15/4}{6} = \\frac{o}{19}\\)  <br>\u202f\u202for  <br>\u202f\u202f\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{15}{4}\\;:\\;6 = o\\;:\\;19\\).  The key is that the \u201ccups per serving\u201d part is one fraction, not a fraction\u2011over\u2011fraction written as a division sign. |\n| **c. Cross\u2011multiply** | \u2705 \u202fYou set \\(\\dfrac{15}{4}\\times 19 = 6o\\) and solved for \\(o\\).  The arithmetic up to \\(\\displaystyle o = \\frac{285}{24}\\) is right. | Now **simplify** that fraction: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{285}{24} = \\frac{95}{8}\\).  In mixed\u2011number form that is \\(11\\frac78\\), and as a decimal (to the nearest hundredth) it is **11.88**. |\n| **d. Unit\u2011rate method** | \u274c \u202fYou didn\u2019t do this part yet. | Find the \u201ccups per serving\u201d first: <br> \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{15/4}{6}= \\frac{15}{4}\\times\\frac{1}{6}= \\frac{15}{24}= \\frac{5}{8}\\)\u202fcup per serving. <br> Then multiply by 19 servings: <br> \\(\\displaystyle o = \\frac{5}{8}\\times19 = \\frac{95}{8}\\).  You\u2019ll see you get the same \\(\\frac{95}{8}\\) as above. |\n| **e. Give three answer forms** | \u274c \u202fOnly the decimal (\u2248\u202f11.875) was shown. | Write the result in all three requested forms: <br>\u202f\u202f\u2022 **Improper fraction:** \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{95}{8}\\) <br>\u202f\u202f\u2022 **Mixed number:** \\(11\\frac78\\) <br>\u202f\u202f\u2022 **Decimal (nearest\u202fhundredth):** **11.88** |\n| **f. Confirming sentence** | \u274c \u202fMissing. | Example: \u201cBoth the cross\u2011multiply method and the unit\u2011rate method give \\(11\\frac78\\)\u202fcups (\u2248\u202f11.88\u202fcups) of oatmeal.\u201d |\n\n**Bottom line:** You nailed the conversion and the algebraic set\u2011up; you just need to finish the unit\u2011rate calculation, simplify the fraction, and write the confirming sentence. You\u2019re *very* close! \ud83d\udc4d  \n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 focus on the **unit\u2011rate** side and simplifying fractions  \n\n> **Problem**  \n> A bakery uses **\\(\\displaystyle \\frac{2}{3}\\)**\u202fpound of sugar to make **4",
