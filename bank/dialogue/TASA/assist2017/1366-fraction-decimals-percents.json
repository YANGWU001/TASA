Moving two places left (7\u202f\u2192\u202f0.07) gives a division by\u202f100, not by\u202f10. |\n\nYou\u2019re solid on the \u201cone\u2011place\u2011left\u201d idea, but the percent step (\u00d7\u202f100) is still slipping, and the decimal\u2011from\u2011a\u2011tenths fraction should be **one** place left, not two.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 lock in the rule and stretch a bit\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3  Fraction\u202f\u2192\u202fdecimal\u202f\u2192\u202fpercent (same denominator\u202f10)\n\nConvert \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{3}{10}\\).\n\n| Decimal | Percent |\n|---------|---------|\n| _______ | _______ % |\n\n*Write the same one\u2011sentence rule you used before.*\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Decimal\u202f\u2192\u202ffraction\u202f\u2192\u202fpercent (still denominator\u202f10)\n\nTake the decimal **0.8**.\n\n| Fraction (lowest terms) | Percent |\n|--------------------------|---------|\n| _______ | _______ % |\n\n*Hint:* Write 0.8 as \\(\\frac{8}{10}\\) first, then simplify; multiply by\u202f100 for the percent.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3  Tiny stretch \u2013 \u201cpercent of\u201d a decimal (multiplying decimals)\n\n**What is 25\u202f% of 0.8?**\n\n1. Write the problem as a multiplication of a decimal and a percent.  \n2. Compute the answer as a **decimal** and then as a **percent**.\n\n*Steps to remember:*  \n- Convert the percent to a decimal (25\u202f% \u2192 0.25).  \n- Multiply the two decimals.  \n- If you want the final answer as a percent, multiply the product by\u202f100.\n\nGive these a try and let me know what you get. If any step feels fuzzy, just ask for a hint\u2014you\u2019re getting there! \ud83c\udf1f",
