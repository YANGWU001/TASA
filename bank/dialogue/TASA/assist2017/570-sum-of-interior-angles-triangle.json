Adding them gives **\\(3y + y = 4y\\)**, not 5y. The constant part is right: \\(-10+20+50 = 60\\). So the simplified left\u2011hand side should be **\\(4y + 60\\)**. |\n| **b)\u202fSolve for\u202f\\(y\\)** | You used the (incorrect) equation \\(5y+60 = 180\\) \u2192 \\(y = 24\\). | \u274c | Because the coefficient of \\(y\\) should be 4, the correct steps are:  <br>\u202f\u202f\\(4y + 60 = 180\\) \u2192 subtract 60 \u2192 **\\(4y = 120\\)** \u2192 divide by\u202f4 \u2192 **\\(y = 30\\)**. |\n| **c)\u202fFind the angles** | You got \\(\\angle D = 62^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle E = 44^\\circ\\). | \u274c | With the right \\(y = 30\\):  <br>\u202f\u202f\\(\\angle D = 3(30)-10 = 80^\\circ\\) <br>\u202f\u202f\\(\\angle E = 30+20 = 50^\\circ\\). |\n| **d)\u202fCheck** | Sum was \\(156^\\circ\\) (because the earlier numbers were off). | \u274c | Using the corrected angles the sum is \\(80^\\circ + 50^\\circ + 50^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\), which confirms the solution. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYou set up the equation perfectly (part\u202fa of the original problem). The only slip was adding the \\(y\\)-terms\u2014remember \\(3y + y = 4y\\). That small arithmetic error rippled through the rest of the work.
