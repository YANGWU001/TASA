Another way: \u201cpick any two of the four apples\u201d \u2192 the possible pairs are \\(\\{A_1,A_2\\},\\{A_1,A_3\\},\\{A_1,A_4\\},\\{A_2,A_3\\},\\{A_2,A_4\\},\\{A_3,A_4\\}\\) \u2013 six of them. |\n| **Choose the 1 banana** \u2013 \\(\\displaystyle\\binom{2}{1}=2\\) | \u2705 Correct | You can pick either banana\u202f1 or banana\u202f2. |\n| **Multiply** \u2013 you used \\(4\\times2=8\\) | Should be \\(6\\times2=12\\) | Because the first factor is 6, not 4. |\n| **Add to the running total** \u2013 you got \\(40+8=48\\) | Correct total is \\(40+12=52\\) | The addition is fine; only the product needed correcting. |\n\n**Bottom line:** You nailed the banana part and the idea of multiplying and adding. The only slip was the value of \\(\\displaystyle\\binom{4}{2}\\). Great effort \u2013 you were only one step off!\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201cof\u2011means\u2011multiply\u201d again  \n\nLet\u2019s keep the same two\u2011step routine, but use a **new pattern** that will let you practice the \\(\\displaystyle\\binom{4}{2}\\) calculation once more (so it sticks).\n\n#### New situation  \n\n- **5 apples** total  \n- **3 bananas** total  \n- **Current running total:** **52** (the sum you just found)\n\n#### New pattern: **\u201c2 apples\u202f+\u202f2 bananas.\u201d**\n\n**Your tasks**\n\n1. **Choose the 2 apples** \u2013 write the combination \\(\\displaystyle\\binom{5}{2}\\) and evaluate it.  \n2. **Choose the 2 bananas** \u2013 write the combination \\(\\displaystyle\\binom{3}{2}\\) and evaluate it.  \n3. **Multiply** the two results to get the number of ways to pick the whole \u201c2\u202fapples\u202f+\u202f2\u202fbananas\u2019\u2019 group.  \n4. **Add** that number to the running total (52) and give the new partial sum.\n\n---\n\n#### A quick hint for step\u202f1  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2}= \\frac{5!}{2!\\,3!}= \\frac{5\\cdot4}{2}=10.\n\\]\n\nIf you want, you can also list a few of the 10 possible apple\u2011",
