The sum of the five\u202f180\u00b0\u202ftriangles (\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f180\u00b0\u202f=\u202f900\u00b0\u202f) therefore counts extra angles that are **not** part of the pentagon\u2019s interior.\n\nThe standard trick is to draw **diagonals from one vertex** (or any single vertex) to all the non\u2011adjacent vertices. That splits an *n\u2011sided* polygon into **(n\u202f\u2013\u202f2) triangles**. Each triangle contributes 180\u00b0, so the interior\u2011angle sum is  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = (n-2)\\times 180^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nFor a pentagon (\u202fn\u202f=\u202f5\u202f):\n\n\\[\n(5-2)\\times180^\\circ = 3\\times180^\\circ = 540^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nSo the correct answer to the first practice problem is **A)\u202f540\u00b0**. Great effort \u2013 you were just one step away!\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 building the idea from the ground up  \n\nBecause the \u201ctriangulation\u201d step is still fresh, let\u2019s reinforce it with a polygon that yields **only two triangles**.  \n\n---\n\n#### Practice Question \u2013 The quadrilateral case  \n\nA convex quadrilateral (a 4\u2011sided polygon) is drawn.  \n\n1. **Draw a single diagonal** that connects two opposite vertices.  \n2. **Count how many triangles** you now have.  \n3. **Add up the interior angles** of those triangles to find the total interior\u2011angle measure of the quadrilateral.\n\n*Show your reasoning step\u2011by\u2011step and write the final sum in degrees.*\n\n**Choices**  \nA)\u202f180\u00b0\u2003\u2003B)\u202f360\u00b0\u2003\u2003C)\u202f540\u00b0\u2003\u2003D)\u202f720\u00b0\n\n---\n\n**Why this question?**  \n\n* It revisits the triangle sum (180\u00b0) you already know.  \n* It introduces the \u201c(n\u202f\u2013\u202f2) triangles\u201d rule in the simplest non\u2011triangular case (n\u202f=\u202f4).  \n* Success here will cement the pattern so that moving to 5\u2011, 6\u2011, or more sides becomes a matter of plugging\u202fn\u202finto the same formula.\n\nGive it a try, and remember: **draw the diagonal, count the triangles, multiply by 180\u00b0**.

Hence when you add the two triangle sums you are counting **each interior angle of the quadrilateral exactly once**.\n\nSo the total interior\u2011angle measure is  \n\n\\[\n2 \\times 180^\\circ = 360^\\circ .\n\\]\n\nTherefore the correct choice is **B)\u202f360\u00b0**.  \nChoosing 180\u00b0 would give you only the sum of *one* of the two triangles, which omits half of the quadrilateral\u2019s interior angles.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 solidify the triangulation idea  \n\nNow that the quadrilateral case is clear, let\u2019s apply the same \u201cdraw diagonals from one vertex\u201d trick to a **regular pentagon** (5 sides).  \n\n#### Practice Question \u2013 Pent\u2011a\u2011sum  \n\n1. **Draw a single vertex** of the pentagon and connect it with straight lines to the two non\u2011adjacent vertices (i.e., draw the two diagonals that emanate from that vertex).  \n2. **How many triangles** are created by those two diagonals?  \n3. **Add up the interior angles** of those triangles to obtain the total interior\u2011angle sum of the pentagon.  \n\n*Write your reasoning step\u2011by\u2011step and give the final sum in degrees.*\n\n**Answer choices**  \n\nA)\u202f540\u00b0\u2003\u2003B)\u202f720\u00b0\u2003\u2003C)\u202f900\u00b0\u2003\u2003D)\u202f1080\u00b0\n\n---\n\n#### Why this question helps\n\n* It repeats the **triangulation** step you just mastered (counting triangles, not worrying about double\u2011counting).  \n* It moves to the next polygon size, so you can see the pattern **(n\u202f\u2013\u202f2)\u202f\u00d7",
