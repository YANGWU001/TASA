Using the diagram (or the numbers), answer the following questions:  \n\n   a. How many students like **only soccer**?  \n   \n   b. How many students like **only basketball**?  \n   \n   c. How many students like **either soccer or basketball (or both)**?  \n\n   d. How many students like **neither** sport?\n\n---\n\n### How to approach  \n\n1. **Start with two overlapping circles** (one for \u201cSoccer\u201d and one for \u201cBasketball\u201d).  \n2. **Place the number 5** in the overlapping region (students who like both).  \n3. **Fill in the \u201conly\u201d regions** by subtracting the overlap from the total for each sport.  \n4. **Add the numbers** in all three regions (only\u2011soccer, only\u2011basketball, both) to find how many like at least one sport.  \n5. Subtract that total from the class size (30) to find the \u201cneither\u201d count.\n\n---\n\n*Give it a try, and when you\u2019re ready you can check your answers below.*\n\n---  \n\n**Answer Key (for later checking)**  \n\na.

Neither sport = 30\u202f\u2212\u202f22 = **8**  \n\n(You can verify these numbers by looking at your completed Venn diagram.)",
