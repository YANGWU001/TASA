      "content": "### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 How you did so far  \n\nYou haven\u2019t written any numbers in the table yet, so we can\u2019t say whether the answer is right or wrong.\u202fThat\u2019s perfectly okay \u2013 the problem introduces a few new \u201cat\u2011least\u2011one\u201d possibilities, and it\u2019s normal to pause and make sure the counting steps are clear.\n\n**What you\u2019ve already mastered**\n\n* Splitting the problem into the two **exactly\u2011one** cases (Carol\u202fin/D\u202fout vs. D\u202fin/Carol\u202fout).  \n* Keeping track of the students that are **forced** (Bob is always in, Alice is always out).  \n\n**What\u2019s new this time**\n\n* Inside each main case you now have to consider three sub\u2011cases for the pair\u202f{E,F}:  \n  1. **E only**  \n  2. **F only**  \n  3. **Both E and F**  \n\nFor each sub\u2011case you must ask:\n\n1. **How many members do we already have?**  \n2. **How many more do we still need to reach 5?**  \n3. **Which students are still free to choose from?**  \n\nOnce you answer those three questions, the count is simply a binomial coefficient  \n\\(\\displaystyle \\binom{\\text{available}}{\\text{still needed}}\\).\n\nIf you fill in the table step\u2011by\u2011step you\u2019ll see the answer emerge.\u202fGive it a try \u2013 use the hints above, and write the numbers you obtain in the \u201cWays to choose\u201d column.  You\u2019ll be surprised how quickly the pieces fall together!\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice question (a gentle stretch)\n\nNow that you\u2019ve practiced a problem with **two** layers of conditions, let\u2019s reinforce the same ideas with a slightly simpler set\u2011up.  This will let you focus on the \u201cexactly\u2011one\u201d and \u201cat\u2011least\u2011one\u201d reasoning without juggling as many students.\n\n> **There are six students: \\( \\{A,B,C,D,E,F\\} \\).**  \n> Form a study group of **exactly 4** students such that  \n> 1. **Alice (A) must not be in the group**,  \n> 2. **Bob (B) must be in the group**,  \n> 3. **Exactly one** of **Carol (C)** or **David (D)** is in the group,  \n> 4. **At least one** of **Eve (E)** or **Frank (F)** is in the group.  \n>   \n> **How many distinct groups satisfy all four conditions?**\n\n#### How to approach it (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\n| Step | What to do |\n|------|------------|\n| **1** | Split on the \u201cexactly\u2011one of C or D\u201d condition \u2192 **Case\u202fA**: C in, D out; **Case\u202fB**: D in, C out. |\n| **2** | In each case list the members you already have (B + the \u201cin\u201d student). |\n| **3** | For the \u201cat\u2011least\u2011one of\u202fE\u202for\u202fF\u201d condition, write the three possibilities: **E only**, **F only**, **both E and F**. |\n| **4** | For every sub\u2011case, count how many more students you still need to reach 4, and how many students are still free (the pool is the remaining students after removing A, the \u201cout\u201d student, and any already\u2011chosen ones). |\n| **5** | Use \\(\\displaystyle \\binom{\\text{available}}{\\text{still needed}}\\) to count the ways for that sub\u2011case. |\n| **6**",
