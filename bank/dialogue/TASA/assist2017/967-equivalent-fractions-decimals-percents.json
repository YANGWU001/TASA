Converting the decimal to a percent**  \nYou started with the (rounded) decimal 0.876 and intended to multiply by 100. The right way is to use the exact decimal you just found:\n\n\\[\n0.875 \\times 100 = 87.5\n\\]\n\nThen attach the percent sign:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{87.5\\%}\n\\]\n\nIf you had kept the rounded value \\(0.876\\), you would have gotten \\(87.6\\%\\), which is slightly off because the original fraction \\(\\tfrac{7}{8}\\) is exactly \\(87.5\\%\\).\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- Decimal: **0.875** (no rounding needed).  \n- Percent: **87.5\u202f%**.\n\nYou were on the right track; just remember that when the result already has the required number of decimal places, you don\u2019t need to round it further.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice \u2013 A Little More Challenge\n\nNow let\u2019s work with a fraction that produces a **repeating decimal**. This will let you practice:\n\n* recognizing when a decimal repeats,  \n* deciding how many places to keep (or round), and  \n* converting to a percent correctly.\n\n### Question\n\nThe fraction \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{5}{12}\\) is given.\n\n1. **Convert the fraction to a decimal** \u2013 write the answer **to three decimal places** (round the last digit if needed).  \n2. **Convert the same value to a percent** \u2013 write the percent **without the % sign**, then add the % symbol.\n\n*Show the key step for each part (division for the decimal, multiplication by 100 for the percent).*\n\n#### Tips\n- **Decimal:** Divide 5 by 12. You\u2019ll get a repeating pattern (0.41666\u2026). Keep the first three decimal places and then round the third digit.\n- **Percent:** You can either multiply the three\u2011decimal\u2011place decimal you just found by 100, **or** multiply the original fraction by 100 first (\\(\\frac{5}{12}\\times100\\)) and then simplify.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get! \ud83c\udf1f",

That\u2019s okay \u2013 the division is the trickiest part, so let\u2019s finish it together and then apply the rounding rules.\n\n| Step | What to do | What you should get |\n|------|------------|---------------------|\n| 1. Divide | \\(5 \\div 12\\) | \\(0.416666\\ldots\\) (the \u201c6\u201d repeats) |\n| 2. Keep three digits after the decimal | The first three digits are **416** | \u2013 |\n| 3. Look at the **fourth** digit to decide how to round the third | The fourth digit is **6** (\u2265\u202f5) | Round the 6\u2011th digit **up** \u2192 **416 \u2192 417** |\n| 4. Write the rounded decimal to three\u202fdp | \\(\\boxed{0.417}\\) | \u2013 |\n| 5. Convert to a percent (multiply by\u202f100) | \\(0.417 \\times 100 = 41.7\\) | The next digit (the hundredths place) is **0**, so no further rounding \u2192 **41.7\u202f%** |\n| 6. Direct\u2011percent check | \\(\\dfrac{5}{12}\\times100 = \\dfrac{500}{12}=41.\\overline{6}\\) \u2192 round the second decimal digit (6\u202f\u2265\u202f5) up to **7** \u2192 **41.7\u202f%** | Same answer as in step\u202f5 |\n\nSo the **complete answer** is  \n\n- Decimal (3\u202fdp): **0.417**  \n- Percent (1\u202fdp): **41.7\u202f%**  \n\nYou were on the right track; you just needed to finish the division and apply the rounding rule. Great effort!\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 \u201cdown\u2011rounding\u201d + \u201cup\u2011rounding\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s work with a fraction that **rounds down** when we write the decimal, but **rounds up** when we turn it into a percent. This will give you practice with both directions in one problem.\n\n### Question\n\nFor the fraction \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{4}{9}\\):\n\n1. **Decimal (to three decimal places)** \u2013 Divide \\(4\\) by \\(9\\). Write the result to three digits after the decimal point, rounding the third digit **down** (the next digit is\u202f<\u202f5).  \n2. **Percent (to two decimal places)** \u2013 Take the rounded decimal from part\u202f1, multiply by \\(100\\), and round the product to two decimal places (the next digit will be\u202f\u2265\u202f5, so you\u2019ll round **up**).  \n3. **Direct\u2011",
