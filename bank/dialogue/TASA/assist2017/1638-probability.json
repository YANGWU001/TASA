What your last response tells me**\n\nYou wrote *\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to answer this.\u201d*  \nThat\u2019s perfectly fine \u2013 it means the problem is still new to you, and you haven\u2019t yet tried to set up the equations.  \nSince you haven\u2019t made an attempt, there\u2019s nothing to label \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d yet.\u202fWhat we\u2019ll do now is break the original jar\u2011problem into bite\u2011size pieces, show exactly how the pieces fit together, and then give you a **guided practice problem** that is a little simpler but still uses the same ideas (probability\u202f+\u202ffraction/ratio reasoning).  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Guided walk\u2011through of the original jar problem  \n\n| Piece of information | How to write it mathematically |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Let **R** = number of red marbles. | **R** (unknown variable) |\n| Let **B** = number of blue marbles. | **B** (unknown variable) |\n| Total marbles = 18 | `R + B = 18` |\n| Probability of red =\u202f`R / 18` | `P(red) = R/18` |\n| Probability of blue =\u202f`B / 18` | `P(blue) = B/18` |\n| \u201cRed is **twice** as likely as blue\u201d | `P(red) = 2\u00b7P(blue)` \u2192 `R/18 = 2\u00b7(B/18)` |\n\nFrom the last line you can cancel the common denominator 18:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{R}{18}=2\\cdot\\frac{B}{18}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;R = 2B .\n\\]\n\nNow you have **two** simple linear equations:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\nR + B = 18\\\\[4pt]\nR = 2B\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nSolve them:\n\n1. Substitute \\(R = 2B\\) into the first equation:  \n   \\(2B + B = 18 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 3B = 18\\) \u2192 \\(B = 6\\).\n2. Then \\(R = 2B = 2\u00b76 = 12\\).\n\n**Answer:** 12 red marbles (and 6 blue marbles).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Next practice question (tailored to your current mastery)\n\nBecause you\u2019re still building confidence with *\u201ctwice as likely\u201d* statements and simple fraction equations, the next problem keeps the same structure but reduces the arithmetic load.\n\n### Practice Question \u2013 \u201cThree\u2011times as likely\u201d\n\nA bag contains only green and yellow beads.  \n\n* The probability of drawing a **green** bead is **three times** the probability of drawing a **yellow** bead.  \n* There are **15** beads in the bag altogether.\n\n**a.** Write a pair of equations that represent the information, using a variable for the number of green beads (call it \\(G\\)).  \n\n**b.** Solve the equations to find **how many green beads** are in the bag (you may also give the number of yellow beads).\n\n---\n\n### Hints to get you started\n\n1. Let \\(Y\\) be the number of yellow beads.  \n2. Total beads: `G + Y = 15`.  \n3. \u201cThree\u2011times as likely\u201d \u2192 \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{G}{15}=3\\cdot\\frac{Y}{15}\\) \u2192 simplify to a relationship between \\(G\\) and \\(Y\\).  \n4. Substitute that relationship into the total\u2011beads equation and solve.\n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re ready, post your equations or your solution. If you get stuck at any step, just let me know which part is confusing and I\u2019ll walk through it with you. You\u2019ve already seen how the \u201ctwice as likely\u201d case works, so you\u2019re well\u2011prepared to handle \u201cthree\u2011times as likely.\u201d Good luck!",

A quick mental check (\u202f\\(B+Y = 18+6 = 24\\)\u202f) confirms the answer is consistent with both equations.\n\n---\n\n### Next practice \u2013 a fresh problem (with a built\u2011in check)\n\n> **Problem**  \n> A bag contains only **purple** (\\(P\\)) and **orange** (\\(O\\)) marbles.  \n> \u2022 The probability of drawing a purple marble is **four\u2011times** the probability of drawing an orange marble.  \n> \u2022 There are **32** marbles in the bag.  \n>   \n> a. Write the two equations that model the situation.  \n> b. Solve the system and give the numbers of purple and orange marbles.  \n> c. **Check** your answer by substituting the numbers back into both equations.\n\n#### Suggested scaffold (feel free to skip any step you\u2019re comfortable with)\n\n1. **Total\u2011marble equation**  \n   \\[\n   P + O = 32\n   \\]\n\n2. **\u201cFour\u2011times as likely\u201d equation** \u2013 translate the probability sentence:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{P}{32}=4\\cdot\\frac{O}{32}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; P = 4O.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitution** \u2013 replace \\(P\\) in the total\u2011marble equation with \\(4O\\):  \n   \\[\n   4O + O = 32 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 5O = 32.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(O\\)**  \n   \\[\n   O = \\frac{32}{5}=6.4.\n   \\]\n\n   *If you get a non\u2011integer, pause and reconsider the multiplier or the total. In a real\u2011world count of marbles we need whole numbers, so something\u2019s off.*\n\n5. **Adjust the problem** \u2013 Because 32 isn\u2019t divisible by 5, let\u2019s **change the total to 30** (a number that works nicely with a 4\u2011to\u20111 ratio).  \n   Re\u2011write the total\u2011marble equation as  \n   \\[\n   P + O = 30.\n   \\]\n\n   Then repeat steps\u202f3\u20114:\n\n   \\[\n   4O + O = 30 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 5O = 30 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; O = 6.\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find \\(P\\)** using \\(P = 4O\\):  \n   \\[\n   P = 4 \\times 6 = 24.\n   \\]\n\n7. **Check**  \n   * Total\u2011marble check: \\(24 + 6 = 30\\) \u2714\ufe0f  \n   * Probability\u2011ratio check: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{24}{30}= \\frac{4}{5",
