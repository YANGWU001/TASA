You travel the length **twice** (top\u202f+\u202fbottom) **and** the width **twice** (left\u202f+\u202fright). The correct formula is  \\(\\displaystyle P = 2L + 2W\\) \u00a0or, more compactly,  \\(\\displaystyle P = 2(L+W)\\). |\n| **Plug\u2011in** | You started with \u201c\\(P = 2L\\)\u201d and stopped | \u274c | Because the formula was missing the second \u201c\\(2W\\)\u201d, the substitution was incomplete. If we use the right formula, the calculation continues: \\(\\displaystyle P = 2(8) + 2(5) = 16 + 10 = 26\\text{\u202fcm}\\). |\n\n**Bottom line:** You remembered that the perimeter involves the length, but the factor for the width was left out. No worries\u2014this is a common slip when the idea is still fresh. Let\u2019s cement the correct relationship with a new, guided practice.\n\n---\n\n### 2.\u202fNext practice \u2013 Building the perimeter idea from the ground up  \n\n**Problem:** A rectangular picture frame is **6\u202fcm long** and **3\u202fcm wide**.  \n\n1. **Fill in the missing pieces of the formula** (write the complete formula for a rectangle\u2019s perimeter).  \n\n   \\[\n   P = \\; \\underline{\\phantom{2L}} \\; L \\; + \\; \\underline{\\phantom{2W}} \\; W\n   \\]\n\n2. **Compute the perimeter** step\u2011by\u2011step, showing each multiplication and addition.  \n\n   *Hint:* Use the numbers \\(L = 6\\)\u202fcm and \\(W = 3\\)\u202fcm.\n\n3. **Explain in one sentence** why the formula has the form it does (think about \u201cgoing around\u201d the shape).\n\n---\n\n#### How this question helps you  \n\n* **Formula reinforcement:** By filling in the blanks you\u2019ll see that *both* the length **and** the width appear twice.  \n* **Step\u2011by\u2011step arithmetic:** Writing every multiplication and addition keeps the process explicit, which is great for rebuilding confidence after a long gap.  \n* **Conceptual check:** The short explanation forces you to connect the algebraic expression to the physical idea of \u201cwalking around\u201d the rectangle.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know each step you write.
