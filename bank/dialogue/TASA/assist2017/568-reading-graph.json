The number of books read steadily decreases.  \nB. The number of books read stays the same each day.  \nC. The number of books read generally increases, with a small dip on one day.  \nD. The number of books read fluctuates randomly with no clear direction.\n\n---\n\n### How to Answer\n\n1. Write the number for Day\u202f4.  \n2. Choose the correct letter (A, B, C, or D) and, in one sentence, explain why that choice matches the data in the table/graph.\n\n*Feel free to sketch the points on a quick piece of paper if that helps you visualise the graph!*",

Write the fruit\u2019s name.\n\n*Tip:* Look at the column \u201cNumber eaten (per week).\u201d The number next to a fruit tells you the height of its bar.\n\n---\n\n### Why this question fits where you are\n\n* **One\u2011to\u2011one mapping** \u2013 you only need to match a label (the fruit) with a single number.  \n* **No trend interpretation yet** \u2013 we\u2019re just practising \u201creading a point/bar\u201d before we ask about overall direction.  \n* **Visual cue** \u2013 even if you can\u2019t see the picture, the table gives you exactly the same information a graph would.\n\nGive it a try and write your answers in complete sentences (e.g., \u201cI eat 5 bananas each week.\u201d).

We\u2019ll go through the four sub\u2011questions one at a time, and this time the numbers are chosen so the answer keys are easy to verify.\n\n| Fruit | Number eaten (per week) |\n|-------|--------------------------|\n| Apples      | **5** |\n| Bananas     | **3** |\n| Cherries    | **5** |\n| Dates       | **2** |\n| Elderberries| **2** |\n\n### Question\u202f8  \n\n1. **Exact reading** \u2013 *How many **dates** do you eat in a week?*  \n   *Write the number exactly as it appears.*\n\n2. **Most bars (all ties)** \u2013 *Which fruit(s) have the most bars?* List **all** fruits that share the highest number.\n\n3. **Fewest bars (all ties)** \u2013 *Which fruit(s) have the fewest bars?* List **all** fruits that share the lowest number.\n\n4. **Tiny\u2011trend step** \u2013 *If you draw a line connecting the points in this order:*  \n   **Apples \u2192 Bananas \u2192 Cherries \u2192 Dates \u2192 Elderberries**,  \n   *does the line from the **first point** (Apples) to the **last point** (Elderberries) **rise**, **fall**, or **stay about the same**?*  \n   *Answer with one word and, if you like, a short reason (e.g., \u201crise \u2013 5\u202f\u2192\u202f2\u201d).*\n\n### Quick hints to keep you on track  \n\n- **Step\u202f1:** Find the row labeled **Dates** and copy the digit next to it.  \n- **Step\u202f2:** Scan the whole \u201cNumber eaten\u201d column, note the biggest value, then go back and list **every** fruit that has that value.  \n- **Step\u202f3:** Do the same, but look for the smallest value.  \n- **Step\u202f4:** Write down the first number (Apples\u202f=\u202f5) and the last number (Elderberries\u202f=\u202f2). Compare them: 5\u202f>\u202f2 \u2192 \u201cfall\u201d; 5\u202f<\u202f2 \u2192 \u201crise\u201d; equal \u2192 \u201cstay about the same.\u201d\n\nTake your time, and remember you can **double\u2011check** each answer before you submit it.
