Add the numbers:\u202f4\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f20  \n2. There are 3 numbers.  \n3. Divide the sum by the count:\u202f20\u202f\u00f7\u202f3\u202f\u2248\u202f6.67  \n\nThe exact mean is **20\u20443 \u2248 6.67**, which is **closest to option\u202fB)\u202f6** (if you\u2019re choosing the nearest whole\u2011number option).\n\n**Answer:** **B)\u202f6** (the mean is 6.67, rounded to the nearest whole number).  \n\n---\n\n**Why this question is a good start**\n\n- It uses only **three small whole numbers**, so the arithmetic is quick.  \n- It forces you to follow the **definition** of mean step\u2011by\u2011step (add \u2192 count \u2192 divide).  \n- The multiple\u2011choice format lets you verify immediately whether the process is clear.\n\nTry a few more similar problems (e.g., with 2 numbers, or with numbers that add up to a tidy total) to rebuild confidence. When you\u2019re comfortable, we\u2019ll move on to slightly larger sets and to interpreting what the mean tells us about a data set. Happy practicing!",

An incorrect sum makes the division and the check wrong, which then leads to the wrong answer choice.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201cSum\u2011first, then mean\u201d  \n\nWe\u2019ll focus on **getting the sum right** before moving on to the mean.

(If the result is not a whole number, write the exact fraction\u202f\\( \\frac{15}{2}\\)\u202for the decimal\u202f7.5.)  \n4. **Multiplication check** \u2013 Multiply your division answer by the count (4\u202f\u00d7\u202f7.5 =\u202f30) to confirm you didn\u2019t slip.\n\nGive these two worksheets a try and send back the filled\u2011in blanks. We\u2019ll see how the sum step goes and then lock in the mean. You\u2019ve already shown you understand the process; a tiny extra pause on the addition will make the rest fall into place. \ud83c\udf1f",
