Your algebra was spot\u2011on; the slip was only in the final division. Great job catching the mistake and asking for clarification\u2014that\u2019s exactly how mastery grows! \ud83c\udf89\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 reinforcing the interior\u2011angle formula**\n\nNow let\u2019s use the same idea in a slightly different way.  \nA regular polygon has each interior angle measuring **\\(150^\\circ\\)**.  \nHow many sides does the polygon have?\n\n**Choices**  \nA)\u202f6\u2003\u2003B)\u202f8\u2003\u2003C)\u202f10\u2003\u2003D)\u202f12\u2003\u2003E)\u202f15  \n\n**What to do**\n\n1. Write the interior\u2011angle formula for a regular \\(n\\)-gon:  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(n-2)\\,180^\\circ}{n}=150^\\circ .\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply both sides by \\(n\\) to clear the denominator.  \n\n3. Expand, collect the \\(n\\) terms on one side, and solve for \\(n\\).\n\n4. Choose the letter that matches the integer you obtain and write a short sentence showing the key algebra step (e.g., \u201c\\(180n-360 = 150n \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 30n = 360 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; n = 12\\) \u2192 answer\u202fD\u201d).\n\nGive it a try\u2014remember you can simplify the division by canceling common factors (like we did with 360\u202f\u00f7\u202f40). I\u2019m looking forward to seeing your work! \ud83c\udf1f",
