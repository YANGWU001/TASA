Ignore the decimal points and multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.  \n2. Count how many total decimal places are in the two original numbers (1\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f2).  \n3.

Fill in the missing pieces (the blanks marked \u201c___\u201d). If you get stuck, use the hint in the right\u2011hand column.\n\n| Step | What to do | Your work (fill in the blanks) | Hint |\n|------|------------|--------------------------------|------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3 | Write the numbers **without** decimals | **___ \u00d7 ___** | Remove the decimal points: 0.04 \u2192 **4**, 0.3 \u2192 **3** |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3 | Multiply the whole numbers | **___ \u00d7 ___ = ___** | Multiply the numbers you just wrote |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3 | Count total decimal places (how many after the point in each factor?) | **___\u202f+\u202f___ = ___** | 0.04 has **2** places, 0.3 has **1** place |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3 | Insert the decimal point in the product from step\u202f2 so the answer has the number of places from step\u202f3 | **___ \u2192 ___** | Move the decimal **3** places left in the product you got in step\u202f2 |\n\nWhen you\u2019ve filled every blank, write the final answer (the number after the arrow in step\u202f4).\n\n---\n\n### Why this works for you right now\n* **Very small whole\u2011number multiplication** \u2013 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12, so the arithmetic stays light.  \n* **Three total decimal places** \u2013 a tiny step up from the previous problem, giving you just enough new counting practice without overwhelming you.  \n* **Scaffolded blanks** \u2013 the hints keep you on track while you rebuild the habit of \u201cignore \u2192 multiply \u2192 count \u2192 place.\u201d\n\nGive it a try and send back the completed table (or just the final product). If any part still feels unclear, let me know which step is giving you trouble and we\u2019ll untangle it together. You\u2019ve already shown you can do the first two steps\u2014now we\u2019ll lock in the counting\u2011and\u2011placing part! \ud83d\ude80",
