The second subtraction follows the same rule, so the correct \u201cOnly\u202fHiking\u201d number is 25, not 30. Once that is right, the \u201cNeither\u201d and \u201cAt\u202fleast\u202fone\u201d totals fall into place automatically. A quick sanity\u2011check is to add **Only\u202fSwimming + Only\u202fHiking + Both + Neither** and see if you get the total number of campers (120).

Write the overlap number (**46**) in the middle of the diagram.  \n2. **Only Vegetables** = 92\u202f\u2013\u202f46.  \n3. **Only Flowers**   = 78\u202f\u2013\u202f46.  \n4. Add the three groups you now have (Only\u202fVegetables + Only\u202fFlowers + Both) and subtract that sum from **150** \u2192 **Neither**.  \n5. **At\u202fleast\u202fone** = sum of the three groups (or 150\u202f\u2013\u202fNeither).\n\n**Give it a try and share the four numbers you obtain.**  \nIf you\u2019d like, start by posting the two \u201conly\u201d numbers first, and we\u2019ll finish the rest together. \ud83c\udf31\u2728",
