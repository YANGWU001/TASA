List the numbers from the smallest value up to the largest.  \n2. Count how many numbers are in the list; the median is the one that has the same number of values on its left and right.\n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re ready, check your answer below.\n\n---\n\n**Answer (for self\u2011check):**  \nOrdered list: **7, 9, 11, 12, 14**  \nMedian: **11**  \n\nIf you got a different result, review the ordering step and make sure you\u2019re counting the positions correctly.

Great job!  \n2. **Finding the median** \u2013\u202fBecause there are **5** values (an odd number), the median is the **third** value in the ordered list, the one that has the same number of items on its left and on its right.  \n   * In the ordered list the positions are:  \n   1\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f7\u2003\u20032\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f9\u2003\u2003**3\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f11**\u2003\u20034\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f12\u2003\u20035\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f14  \n   The middle (3rd) entry is **11**, not 12.  \n\nSo the correct median for this set is **11**.

You\u2019ve already shown you can sort correctly\u2014now we\u2019ll cement the median rule. You\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\ude80",
