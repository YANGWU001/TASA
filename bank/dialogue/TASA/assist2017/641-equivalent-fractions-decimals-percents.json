So the correct answer is **60\u202f%**. |\n\nYou nailed the first step (recognizing \u201csix\u2011tenths\u201d). The next two steps just need a tiny reminder about *dividing by the same number* and *scaling by 100*. That\u2019s perfectly normal after a long break\u2014let\u2019s rebuild the skill step\u2011by\u2011step.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next practice \u2013 one operation at a time  \n\nBecause the ideas are still fresh in your mind, we\u2019ll focus on **just one conversion** before moving on.  \n\n### Part\u202fA \u2013 Turn a decimal into a fraction (no simplification yet)\n\n**Write the decimal 0.8 as a fraction.**  \n*(Think \u201ceight tenths\u201d.)*  \n\n| Your answer |\n|------------|\n| \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{ \\; ? \\; }{ \\; ? \\; }\\) |\n\n---\n\n### Part\u202fB \u2013 Simplify that fraction  \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, simplify the fraction you just wrote.  \n\n| Your answer |\n|------------|\n| \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{ \\; ? \\; }{ \\; ? \\; }\\) |\n\n---\n\n### Part\u202fC \u2013 Turn the same decimal into a percent  \n\nFinally, change 0.8 into a percent.  \n\n| Your answer |\n|------------|\n| \\(\\; ? \\; \\%\\) |\n\n---\n\n#### Guided hints you can use (pick any you need)\n\n1. **Decimal \u2192 fraction**  \n   * \u201c0.8\u201d means *eight tenths* \u2192 start with \\(\\dfrac{8}{10}\\).\n\n2. **Simplify**  \n   * Find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator.  \n   * 8 and 10 are both divisible by **2**. Divide each by 2: \\(\\dfrac{8\u00f72}{10\u00f72} = \\dfrac{4}{5}\\).\n\n3. **Decimal \u2192 percent**  \n   * Multiply the decimal by 100: \\(0.8 \u00d7 100 = 80\\).  \n   * Write it as **80\u202f%**.\n\n---\n\n### What to do next  \n\n1. Fill in the blanks for **Part\u202fA**.  \n2. If you feel confident, move on to **Part\u202fB**; otherwise, let me know which step feels fuzzy and we\u2019ll review it together.  \n3. Finally, try **Part\u202fC**.\n\nYou\u2019ve already demonstrated that you can read \u201csix tenths\u201d; now it\u2019s just a matter of applying the same ideas to a new number. Take it one piece at a time\u2014you\u2019ve got this! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n*Whenever you\u2019re ready, type your answers or ask",
