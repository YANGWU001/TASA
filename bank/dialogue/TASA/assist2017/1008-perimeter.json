When you finish, you\u2019ll have the exact value of \\(w\\) and the outer perimeter.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 a fresh problem (same skills, new numbers)**  \n\nA rectangular garden measures **10\u202fm** by **6\u202fm**. A uniform grass walkway surrounds the garden on all four sides. The total area (garden\u202f+\u202fwalkway) is **200\u202fm\u00b2**.\n\n**Your tasks**\n\n1. **Set up and solve the area equation** to find the walkway width \\(w\\) (round to two decimal places).  \n2. **Compute the perimeter** of the outer edge of the walkway.  \n3. **Verify** your answer by plugging \\(w\\) back into the area expression and confirming you obtain about\u202f200\u202fm\u00b2.\n\n**Hints (just a reminder of the steps you just practiced)**  \n\n- Outer length = \\(10+2w\\); outer width = \\(6+2w\\).  \n- Total area: \\((10+2w)(6+2w)=200\\).  \n- Expand, bring all terms to one side \u2192 quadratic in \\(w",
