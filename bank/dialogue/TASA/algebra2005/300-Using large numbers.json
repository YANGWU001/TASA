Write the number **4,837,259** in words.  \n2. In the number you just wrote, what is the **value of the digit 7** (the digit that appears in the thousands place)?\n\n---\n\n### Why this question fits your current level\n* It uses a **single, seven\u2011digit number**\u2014large enough to practice place\u2011value concepts but not overwhelming.  \n* The first part (writing the number in words) reinforces reading large numbers, a skill that tends to fade quickly without practice.  \n* The second part (finding the value of a specific digit) focuses on a single, concrete piece of knowledge, giving you a clear, achievable target to rebuild confidence.\n\n---\n\n#### Hint (if you need it)\n\n* **Writing in words:** Break the number into groups of three digits from the right (millions, thousands, units).  \n  * 4\u202fmillion \u2192 \u201cfour million\u201d  \n  * 837\u202fthousand \u2192 \u201ceight hundred thirty\u2011seven thousand\u201d  \n  * 259 \u2192 \u201ctwo hundred fifty\u2011nine\u201d\n\n* **Value of a digit:** The digit 7 is in the **thousands place**.

Hundreds = 100, so its value is 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 = **200**.\n\nWrite your answers below (or just think them through). If anything feels fuzzy, let me know and we can break it down even further.

The digit **3** is the *ten\u2011thousands* digit, so its value is **3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f000 = 30\u202f000**. |\n| **B\u20112 \u2013 value of the digit\u202f1** | 100 | \u2705 **Correct** | The \u201c1\u201d is in the *hundreds* position of the last block (108), so its value is **1\u202f\u00d7\u202f100 = 100**. |\n\nYou nailed the wording and the value of the \u201c1\u201d. The only snag was the place\u2011value of the \u201c3\u201d. Remember: when you break a large number into three\u2011digit blocks, each block still carries its own \u201chundreds\u2011tens\u2011ones\u201d labels **relative to the whole number** (millions, hundred\u2011thousands, ten\u2011thousands, \u2026). The \u201c3\u201d sits two places to the left of the thousands column, i.e., in the ten\u2011thousands column.\n\nGreat effort! Let\u2019s lock that idea in with a new, similarly\u2011structured problem.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201cten\u2011thousands and hundred\u2011thousands\u201d**\n\nWe\u2019ll work with a number that also contains a silent zero, but gives a clear view of the ten",
