Because one factor is negative, the product must be **negative** \u2192 \\(-15\\). |\n| 2.\u202fAdd the constant \\(-13\\) | \\(-12 + (-13) = -25\\) | \\(-15 + (-13) = -28\\) | Once the product is \\(-15\\), \u201cadding a negative\u201d means you keep the minus sign: \\(-15-13 = -28\\). |\n| 3.\u202fFinal \\(y\\) | \\(-25\\) | \\(-28\\) | The correct value of \\(y\\) is \\(\\boxed{-28}\\). |\n\nSo the only piece that needs fixing is the multiplication by a negative number. The rule to remember:\n\n> **Positive\u202f\u00d7\u202fNegative = Negative** (multiply the magnitudes, then give the result a minus sign).\n\nGreat effort\u2014once the multiplication is solid, the rest follows automatically!\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 \u201cfind\u202f\\(y\\)\u201d on a positive\u2011slope line with a negative\u202f\\(x\\) and a negative constant**\n\nLet\u2019s keep the same three\u2011step scaffold, but use new numbers so you can rehearse the multiplication rule.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{y = 3x - 7}\n\\]\n\n**Task:** Find \\(y\\) when \\(x = -4\\).\n\nFill in each blank (you can type the numbers or just give the final answer).\n\n1. **Multiply** the slope (3) by the given\u202f\\(x\\) (\u20114).  \n   \\[\n   3 \\times (-4)= \\underline{\\phantom{____}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add** the constant term (\u20117) to that product. Remember: \u201c+\u202f(\u20117)\u201d means keep the minus sign.  \n   \\[\n   \\underline{\\phantom{____}} \\;+\\; (-7)= \\underline{\\phantom{____}}\n   \\]\n\n3. Write the final result as \\(y =\\)\u202f____.\n\n> **Hint:** First compute \\(3\\times4 = 12\\); because one factor is negative, the product is \\(-12\\). Then \\(-12 + (-7) = -19\\).\n\nGive it a try and post the numbers you obtain in each blank. You\u2019re doing great\u2014once the multiplication step clicks, the rest will be routine! \ud83c\udf1f",
