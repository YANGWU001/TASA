Simplify the fraction (you don\u2019t have to compute the final numeric value if you just want the expression).  \n4. Look at the sign of the resulting fraction to decide if the slope is positive.\n\n---\n\n### Example of what a complete answer looks like  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{\\,x_2-x_1\\,}= \\frac{9-3}{5-2}= \\frac{6}{3}=2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(2>0\\), **the slope is positive**.\n\n---\n\nGive it a try!
