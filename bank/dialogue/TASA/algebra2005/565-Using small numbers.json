Remember \u201cwhat you do to one side, you must do to the other.\u201d | \\(5a - 4 - 2a = 2a + 5 - 2a\\) |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3   | Now you have an equation with only one \\(a\\) term on the left and numbers on both sides. Move the constant \\(-4\\) to the right by **adding 4** to both sides. | \\((5a-2a) = (5+4)\\) after you add 4. |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3   | You\u2019ll end up with something like \\(3a = 9\\). Divide both sides by the coefficient of \\(a\\) (here, 3). | \\(a = 9 \u00f7 3 = 3\\). |\n\nGive it a try and post the three lines you obtain. If any step feels fuzzy, just tell me \u201cStep\u202f2 is confusing\u201d (or whichever) and I\u2019ll walk you through that part in detail. You\u2019ve already shown you can add/subtract constants and divide\u2014now we\u2019ll add the skill of moving a variable term across the equals sign. You\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\ude80",
