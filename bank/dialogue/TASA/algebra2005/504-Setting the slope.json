The error most likely came from mixing up the numbers (perhaps using \\(10-3\\) or \\(7-2\\) instead of the proper differences). The good news: the process you used\u2014rise over run\u2014is exactly right; we just need to plug in the right values.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 What to do next**\n\nLet\u2019s practice the *rise\u2011run* step a little more, keeping the arithmetic simple. Work through each sub\u2011question and write just the answer for that step before moving on.\n\n### New points\n\n\\[\nP = (1,\\,4) \\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad Q = (5,\\,12)\n\\]\n\n#### a) Find the **rise**  \n\\[\n\\text{rise} = \\; ?\n\\]\n\n#### b) Find the **run**  \n\\[\n\\text{run} = \\; ?\n\\]\n\n#### c) Compute the **slope** \\(m = \\dfrac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}}\\) and simplify if possible.  \n\n---\n\n**How to answer**\n\n1. Write the rise as a single number.  \n2. Write the run as a single number.  \n3. Form the fraction and reduce it.\n\nIf you get stuck on any part, just let me know which step, and I\u2019ll give a quick hint. You\u2019ve already shown you understand the *idea* of rise over run\u2014let\u2019s nail down the arithmetic! \ud83c\udf1f",
