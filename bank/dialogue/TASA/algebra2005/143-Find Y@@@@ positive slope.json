Follow each line, copy it onto your own paper, and say the words out loud (\u201cthe intercept is \u2026\u201d, \u201cthe slope is \u2026\u201d, etc.). When you feel comfortable, you\u2019ll complete the next practice problem on your own.\n\n---\n\n#### Guided solution (example)\n\n> **Problem** \u2013 A line passes through \\((0,-2)\\) with a positive slope\u202f5.  \n\n1. **Intercept** \u2013 The point where \\(x=0\\) is \\((0,-2)\\).  \n   - The *y\u2011coordinate* is \\(-2\\).  \n   - **\\(b = -2\\)** (keep the minus sign exactly as it appears).  \n\n2. **Slope** \u2013 The problem tells us the slope is \\(5\\).  \n   - **\\(m = 5\\)**.  \n\n3. **Equation** \u2013 Plug \\(m\\) and \\(b\\) into \\(y = mx + b\\).  \n   - \\(y = 5x + (-2)\\) \u2192 simplify \u2192 **\\(y = 5x - 2\\)**.  \n\n4. **Substitution** \u2013 Find \\(y\\) when \\(x = 4\\).  \n   - \\(y = 5(4) - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18\\).  \n\nSo the complete answer is  \n\n```\n1. b = -2\n2. m = 5\n3. y = 5x - 2\n4. y = 18\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Your next practice \u2013 \u201ckeep the sign of the intercept exactly as given\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019ll try a *new* problem on your own, using the same four\u2011step template.

The number is **9**; keep the **plus** sign.  \n* **Slope** \u2013 The problem says \u201cpositive slope of \u20133\u201d. That wording means the slope value is **\u20113** (a negative number) \u2013 the word \u201cpositive\u201d refers to the *direction* of the line (it still goes upward to the left).
