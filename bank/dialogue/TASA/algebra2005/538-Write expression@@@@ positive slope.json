Let\u2019s take the next step together and practice a problem where the slope *must* be positive.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201cWrite the expression for a **positive** slope\u201d\n\nBelow is one point\u2011pair that guarantees a positive slope.  \nFollow the three\u2011step routine **exactly** as you did before, and write the slope as a **simplified fraction** (you don\u2019t need the full line equation yet).\n\n| Problem | Points | Why the slope is positive |\n|---------|--------|---------------------------|\n| **E**   | \\(Y(0,\\,1)\\) and \\(Z(4,\\,5)\\) | Both the rise **and** the run are positive \u2192 positive quotient |\n\n#### How to answer  \n\nUse the same three\u2011line format you used for Problems\u202fA and\u202fB:\n\n```\nProblem E\nRise = ___\nRun  = ___\nm    = ___ (simplified)\n```\n\n**Hints (you can keep them hidden if you want to try on your own first):**\n\n* **Rise** = \\(y_2 - y_1 = 5 - 1 = 4\\)  \n* **Run**  = \\(x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 0 = 4\\)  \n* **Slope** = \\(\\dfrac{\\text{Rise}}{\\text{Run}} = \\dfrac{4}{4}\\).
