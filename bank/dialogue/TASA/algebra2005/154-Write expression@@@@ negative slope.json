The slope\u2011intercept form is \\(y = mx + b\\), where \\(m\\) is the slope and \\(b\\) is the\u202f\\(y\\)-intercept.  \n2. The slope is given directly as \\(-2\\).  \n3. When \\(x = 0\\), the point \\((0,5)\\) tells you the value of \\(y\\); that value is the \\(y\\)-intercept \\(b\\).\n\n---\n\n**What to do:**  \n- Write the number for the slope in the first blank.  \n- Write the number for the \\(y\\)-intercept in the second blank.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, check your answer below.\n\n---\n\n### Solution (for you to compare after you\u2019ve tried)\n\n\\[\ny = -2x + 5\n\\]\n\nIf you got the same result, great! If not, review the hint and try again. This simple exercise will help rebuild your skill in writing equations of lines that have a negative slope. Keep practicing!",

You\u2019ve now shown you can:\n\n1. Multiply a negative by a positive.  \n2. Recognize that **subtracting a negative becomes addition**.  \n3. Assemble the pieces into a clean equation.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 \u201cNegative slope, point in the second quadrant\u201d\n\nA line has a **negative slope** of \\(-2\\) and passes through the point \\((-3,\\;4)\\).\n\nYour tasks (fill in the blanks):\n\n1. **Compute the product \\(mx\\)** using \\(m = -2\\) and \\(x = -3\\).  \n2. **Find the \\(y\\)-intercept** with \\(b = y - mx\\) (here \\(y = 4\\)).  \n3. **Write the full equation** in slope\u2011intercept form \\(y = mx + b\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{y = \\ \\_\\_ \\; x \\ + \\ \\_\\_}\n\\]\n\n#### Hints\n\n| Step | What to remember |\n|------|------------------|\n| **1. Multiply** | Two negatives give a **positive**: \\((-2)(-3)=?\\) |\n| **2. Subtract** | Plug that product into \\(b = y - mx\\). If the product is positive, you\u2019ll be **subtracting a positive** (just ordinary subtraction). |\n| **3. Assemble** | Keep the original slope \\(-2\\) and place the intercept you just found into the formula. |\n\nGive it a try and let me know the numbers you obtain for the blanks (or ask for help on any step). You\u2019ve already proven you can handle the sign rules",
