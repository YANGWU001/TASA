She then starts studying for her math quiz. After a **2\u2011hour\u2011and\u201130\u2011minute** study session, she looks at the clock again.  \n> \n> **a.** What time does the clock show when Emma finishes studying?  \n> **b.** How many minutes in total did Emma study?\n\n---\n\n### Why this question fits where you\u2019re at\n* **Reading a clock** (recognizing 3\u202f:\u202f45) \u2013 a basic skill you\u2019ve begun to practice.  \n* **Adding hours and minutes** \u2013 a simple \u201ctime\u2011addition\u201d operation that builds on the same idea.  \n* **Converting the elapsed time to minutes** \u2013 reinforces the connection between hours and minutes (1\u202fhour\u202f=\u202f60\u202fminutes).\n\n---\n\n### Quick Hint (if you get stuck)\n\n* When you add minutes, start by adding the minutes part first. If the sum goes past 60, convert the excess into an extra hour.\n* To change hours\u202f+\u202fminutes into total minutes, multiply the hours by 60 and then add the remaining minutes.\n\n---\n\n### Solution\n\n**a. Adding the study time to 3\u202f:\u202f45\u202fPM**\n\n1. Add the minutes: 45\u202fmin\u202f+\u202f30\u202fmin\u202f=\u202f75\u202fmin.  \n   75\u202fmin = 1\u202fhour\u202f+\u202f15\u202fmin (because 75\u202f\u2013\u202f60\u202f=\u202f15).  \n2. Add the extra hour to the original hour: 3\u202fPM\u202f+\u202f2\u202fh\u202f+\u202f1\u202fh\u202f=\u202f6\u202fPM.  \n3. Keep the remaining 15\u202fminutes.\n\n**Answer:** The clock shows **6\u202f:\u202f15\u202fPM** when Emma finishes studying.\n\n---\n\n**b. Converting the study interval to minutes**\n\n* 2\u202fhours\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f=\u202f120\u202fminutes  \n* 2\u202fhours\u202f+\u202f30\u202fminutes = 120\u202fmin\u202f+\u202f30\u202fmin = **150\u202fminutes**\n\n**Answer:** Emma studied for **150 minutes** in total.\n\n---\n\n### What to do next\n* Try a similar problem but change the start time (e.g., 11\u202f:\u202f20\u202fAM) and the length of the activity (e.g., 1\u202fhour\u202f45\u202fminutes).  \n* Then, attempt a \u201cbackward\u201d question: *If Emma finishes at 9\u202f:\u202f05\u202fPM after a 2\u2011hour\u201115\u2011minute activity, what time did she start?*  \n\nThese will keep reinforcing the same skill while gently stretching it.
