Finish the subtraction and you\u2019ll have the answer. |\n| 3 | (Cube of\u202f4) \u2013 not started | **Not attempted** | To cube 4, first find \\(4\\times4 = 16\\); then multiply that result by 4 again: \\(16\\times4 = **64**. So \\(4^3 = 64\\). |\n| 4 | (Square of\u202f2) \u2013 not started | **Not attempted** | \\(2\\times2 = 4\\) (or \u201c2\u202f+\u202f2 = 4\u201d). |\n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing by **breaking a harder multiplication into two easier pieces**. The only hiccup is the final addition or subtraction\u2014just double\u2011check that last step, and you\u2019ll be spot\u2011on.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 \u201cmultiply\u2011by\u2011itself\u201d with a safety net  \n\nLet\u2019s reinforce the *final* addition/subtraction step with a problem that\u2019s just a little bit different, so you can see the pattern clearly.\n\n### Problem  \n\n**Square of\u202f7**  \n\n*Hint:* Write it as \\((7\\times6)+7\\).  \n\n1. Compute the \u201c6\u2011times\u20117\u201d part.  \n2. Then add the extra 7.  \n\nWrite each line just as you did before, e.g.:\n\n```\n7 \u00d7 7 = \u2026\n7 \u00d7 6 = \u2026\n\u2026 + 7 = \u2026\n```\n\nWhen you finish, tell me the final answer.  \n\n*(If you want a quick sanity\u2011check, you can also count \u201cseven\u202f7\u2019s\u201d on your fingers or on a number line: 7\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f7\u202f+\u202f7 = ?)*  \n\nGive it a try, and I\u2019ll let you know right away if the numbers line up. You\u2019ve got the strategy\u2014now let\u2019s lock in the arithmetic! \ud83c\udf1f",
