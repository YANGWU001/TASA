That\u2019s exactly the first step of the prime\u2011factor method, so you\u2019re on the right track!\n\n**What still needs to happen**  \n\n| Number | Prime factorisation | Why it matters |\n|--------|----------------------|----------------|\n| 14 | \\(2^{1}\\times 7^{1}\\) | introduces the primes 2 and\u202f7 |\n| 18 | \\(2^{1}\\times 3^{2}\\) | brings in 3 with exponent\u202f2 |\n| 27 | \\(3^{3}\\) | raises the exponent of 3 to\u202f3 (the highest we\u2019ll need) |\n| 35 | \\(5^{1}\\times 7^{1}\\) | adds a new prime 5; 7 is already present |\n| 13 | \\(13^{1}\\) | a brand\u2011new prime that appears only once |\n\nOnce the factorisations are filled in, the next step is **pick the highest power of each prime that appears** (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f13) and multiply those \u201chighest\u2011power\u201d pieces together.  \n\nSo your work is **correct in spirit**, but it\u2019s incomplete.
