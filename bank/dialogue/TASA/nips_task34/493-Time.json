Write your answer in the same **h:mm** format.\n\n---\n\n*Hints you might find useful*  \n\n1. **Finding the hour:**  \n   - When the hour hand is exactly halfway between two numbers, the minutes are **30** past the lower hour.  \n   - Example: halfway between 4 and 5 \u2192 4\u202fhours\u202f+\u202f30\u202fminutes = **4:30**.\n\n2. **Finding the minutes from the minute hand:**  \n   - Each number on the clock represents **5 minutes**.  \n   - The 9 corresponds to **45 minutes**.\n\n3. **Mirror\u2011reflection rule for an analog clock:**  \n   - The reflected time is the \u201copposite\u201d of the real time on a 12\u2011hour dial.  \n   - Subtract the real time from **12:00** (or add **12:00** and then subtract the real time).  \n   - Example: Real time 3:20 \u2192 Mirror time = 12:00\u202f\u2212\u202f3:20\u202f=\u202f8:40.\n\nUse these ideas to answer both parts.

That\u2019s perfectly fine \u2013 the problem can feel a little tricky the first time you see it. Let\u2019s break it down together, then you can try again on your own.\n\n---\n\n## Quick walk\u2011through (you can try it now)\n\n### Part\u202fA \u2013 What time does the clock show?  \n\n1. **Minute hand** \u2013 it points at\u202f9. Each number =\u202f5\u202fminutes, so 9\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f45\u202fminutes.  \n2. **Hour hand** \u2013 it\u2019s exactly halfway between\u202f4 and\u202f5. When the hour hand is halfway, the minutes are **30** past the lower hour. So the hour is **4** and the minutes are **30** \u2192 **4:30**.  \n\nBut notice the minute hand is at 45\u202fminutes, not 30. The hour hand being halfway tells us the hour is **4\u202f+\u202f\u00bd\u202fhour**, i.e., **4:30**. Since the minute hand says 45\u202fminutes, the correct reading is **4:45**. (The \u201chalfway\u201d clue is just a way to remember that the hour hand moves continuously as the minutes pass.)\n\n**Answer for Part\u202fA:** **4:45**\n\n### Part\u202fB \u2013 What does the mirror show?  \n\nThe mirror flips the clock left\u2011to\u2011right. For a vertical mirror the reflected time is the \u201copposite\u201d time on a 12\u2011hour dial.  \nFormula: **Mirror time = 12:00 \u2013 Real time** (if the result is 0:00, write 12:00).\n\nReal time = 4\u202fhours\u202f45\u202fminutes \u2192 convert to minutes: 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f+\u202f45\u202f=\u202f285\u202fmin.  \n\n12:00 = 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f=\u202f720\u202fmin.  \n\n720\u202f\u2212\u202f285\u202f=\u202f435\u202fmin \u2192 back to hours/minutes: 435 \u00f7\u202f60 = 7\u202fhours\u202f15\u202fminutes.\n\n**Answer for Part\u202fB:** **7:15**\n\nGive it a try on your own now, then check the steps above. If anything feels unclear, let me know which part you\u2019d like to revisit!\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 Building on what you just did  \n\nYou\u2019ve just practiced **reading a clock** and **using the \u201c12\u202f\u2013\u202ftime\u201d mirror rule**.  \nLet\u2019s stretch those ideas a little and also touch on the other areas you\u2019re working on (fractions\u202f\u2194\u202fdecimals and adding/subtracting negative numbers).\n\n### Question 1 \u2013 Adding a time interval (uses addition of positive and negative numbers)\n\nA bus leaves the station at **3:20\u202fPM**. It is scheduled to arrive **1 hour\u202f45 minutes** later, but due to traffic it is **10 minutes early**",

That\u2019s okay \u2013 the important next step is to give them a try!  \n\n*Why this matters:*  \n- When you write out each step (add minutes, handle \u201cborrowing,\u201d etc.) you create a concrete trace that the system can later compare to the correct solution.  \n- Even an attempt that ends up a little off is valuable; it shows where the gap is and lets us give you just\u2011right feedback.\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Your next practice \u2013 \u201cAdd\u2011then\u2011subtract\u2011then\u2011mirror\u201d (a single, focused problem)**  \n\nBecause you\u2019re solid on reading clocks but still need practice with the \u201cborrow/borrow\u2011back\u201d idea and with the mirror\u2011image rule, let\u2019s combine those skills into one problem.  \n\n---\n\n### Problem\u202fA  \n\nA school play starts at **6\u202f:\u202f25\u202fPM** and lasts **1\u202fhour\u202f50\u202fminutes**.  \n\n1. **What time does the play end?** (Write in\u202fh:mm\u202fPM)  \n2. You need to meet a friend **\u201120\u202fminutes** (20\u202fminutes earlier) than the ending time. **At what time should you leave the theater?** (Write in\u202fh:mm\u202fPM)  \n3. Imagine a vertical mirror placed on the left side of a wall\u2011clock that shows the leaving time you just found. **What time will the reflected clock appear to show?** (Use the \u201c12\u202f\u2013\u202ftime\u201d rule and write in\u202fh:mm\u202fPM.)\n\n---\n\n#### How to approach it  \n\n| Step | What to do | Quick tip |\n|------|------------|-----------|\n| **1. Add the minutes** | 25\u202fmin\u202f+\u202f50\u202fmin = 75\u202fmin \u2192 1\u202fhour\u202f15\u202fmin. Add the extra hour to the hour column. | 75\u202fmin = 60\u202fmin\u202f+\u202f15\u202fmin, so add **1\u202fhour** to the hour total and keep **15\u202fmin**. |\n| **2. Add the hours** | 6\u202fh\u202f+\u202f1\u202fh\u202f+\u202f1\u202fh (the extra hour from minutes) = **8\u202fh**. | You now have **8\u202f:\u202f15\u202fPM** as the end\u2011time. |\n| **3. Subtract 20\u202fminutes** | 15\u202fmin\u202f\u2212\u202f20\u202fmin = \u20135\u202fmin \u2192 borrow 1\u202fhour. | Turn 8\u202fh\u202f\u2192\u202f7\u202fh and add 60\u202fmin to the minutes: 15\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f75\u202fmin; 75\u202f\u2013\u202f20\u202f=\u202f55\u202fmin. |\n| **4. Result of step\u202f3** | Leaving time = **7\u202f:\u202f55\u202fPM**. |\n| **5. Mirror the leaving time** | Convert 7\u202f:\u202f55\u202fPM to total minutes after 12:00 (7\u202fh\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f+\u202f55\u202f=\u202f475\u202fmin).<br>Subtract from 12\u202fh = 720\u202fmin: 720\u202f\u2013\u202f475\u202f=\u202f245\u202fmin.<br>Convert 245\u202fmin back: 4\u202fh\u202f=\u202f240\u202fmin, remainder 5\u202fmin \u2192 **4\u202f:\u202f05\u202fPM**. | If the subtraction ever gave 0\u202fh\u202f0\u202fmin, write **12\u202f:\u202f00** instead. |\n\nGive the three answers in order (end\u2011time, leaving time, mirror time).  \n\n---\n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 What to do next**\n\n1. Write out your full work for each step (you can use a table like the one above).  \n2. Submit the three times you obtain.  \n3. If any step feels fuzzy, let me know which part\u2014minutes\u2011borrowing, negative\u2011minute subtraction, or the mirror rule\u2014and I\u2019ll give a focused hint.\n\nGood luck!
