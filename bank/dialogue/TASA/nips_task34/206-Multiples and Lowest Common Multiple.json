For each prime that shows up, write down the **largest exponent** that appears in either factorisation.  \n   - Example format: \\(2^{?}\\), \\(3^{?}\\)\n\n3.

This question isolates each sub\u2011skill, gives you a concrete \u201ccheck\u201d (the factorisation step), and uses smaller numbers so the arithmetic stays smooth.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know where you get stuck (if anywhere).
