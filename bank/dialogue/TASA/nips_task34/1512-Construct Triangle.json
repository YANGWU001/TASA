This is the first piece of a right\u2011angle construction. | The statement *\u201cAB is the ends of a diameter of a circle centred at\u202fP\u201d* is not accurate.  The points **A** and **B** lie on the same circle centred at\u202fP, but they are **not** opposite ends of a diameter; they are just two points at the same distance from\u202fP on opposite sides of the line **PQ**.  To get a perpendicular you must: <br>\u202f\u202f1. From **A** and **B** draw arcs of equal radius that intersect at a point **C** (you did this in Step\u202f3). <br>\u202f\u202f2.

Draw the ray **PF**.  **PF** is the bisector of the right angle, therefore it makes **45\u00b0** with **PQ**. |\n| **Missing steps** | \u2013 | After you have the 45\u00b0 ray **PF**, you still need to: <br>\u202f\u202f1. Set the compass to **5\u202fcm**, swing an arc from **P** onto the ray **PF**, call the intersection **R** (so **PR = 5\u202fcm**). <br>\u202f\u202f2. Draw the segment **QR** to close the triangle. <br>\u202f\u202f3. State a final check: *\u2220QPR = 45\u00b0 because **PF** is the bisector of a right angle; PQ = 6\u202fcm by construction; PR = 5\u202fcm by the compass setting.* |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYour overall plan (SAS \u2013 two sides and the included 45\u00b0 angle) is spot\u2011on, and you have already built the right angle correctly.
