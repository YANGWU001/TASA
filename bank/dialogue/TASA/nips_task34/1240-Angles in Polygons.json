Once you have \\(n\\), the exterior angle is easy because interior\u202f+\u202fexterior\u202f=\u202f\\(180^\\circ\\) for any polygon.\n\n**Quick reminder of the remaining steps**\n\n1. Write the equation  \n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{(n-2)180^\\circ}{n}=150^\\circ .\n   \\]\n\n2. Multiply both sides by \\(n\\) and solve for \\(n\\).  \n   \\[\n   (n-2)180 = 150n \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 180n - 360 = 150n \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 30n = 360 \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; n = 12.\n   \\]\n\n3. Exterior angle = \\(180^\\circ - 150^\\circ = 30^\\circ\\).\n\nYou were on the right track; you just need to finish the algebra. Great start!\n\n---\n\n### Next practice \u2013 reinforce the same ideas\n\nA regular polygon has each interior angle measuring **\\(135^\\circ\\)**.\n\n1. **How many sides does this polygon have?**  \n2. **What is the measure of each exterior angle of the polygon?**  \n\n*Show all of your work, using the interior\u2011angle formula and the relationship between interior and exterior angles.*\n\n---\n\n**Why this question?**  \n\nYour recent attempts show you understand that the interior\u2011angle formula is the key tool, but the algebraic manipulation still needs a little practice. This problem uses a different interior\u2011angle value, giving you another chance to apply the same steps and solidify the process.  \n\nGive it a try, and remember: each correct step you write down is a step toward stronger mastery! \ud83d\ude80",
