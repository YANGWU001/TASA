Using the correct reflected point \\((-4,5)\\) gives \\(\\big(-4.5,\\;4.5\\big)\\). This point does satisfy \\(y=-x\\) because \\(4.5 = -(-4.5)\\). |\n\n**Key take\u2011away:**  \nYou know the *idea* of \u201cswap and change signs\u201d, but the sign\u2011change has to be applied to **both** numbers after the swap.
