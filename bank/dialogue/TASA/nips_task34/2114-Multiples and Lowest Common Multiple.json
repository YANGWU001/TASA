Seeing two ways to get the same answer helps cement the concept.\n\n### Question\n\n**Find the lowest common multiple of 9 and 15.**  \n\n1. **Listing multiples** \u2013 Write the first several multiples of each number until you see a common one.  \n2. **Prime\u2011factor method** \u2013  \n   - Write the prime factorization of each number.  \n   - For each distinct prime, take the highest power that appears in either factorization.  \n   - Multiply those highest\u2011power primes together to get the LCM.  \n\n#### Show your work like this (you can adapt the format):\n\n- Multiples of 9: \u2026  \n- Multiples of 15: \u2026  \n- Smallest common multiple (from the lists): **____**  \n\n- Prime factorization:  \n  - 9 = \u2026  \n  - 15 = \u2026  \n\n- Highest\u2011power primes: \u2026  \n\n- LCM from prime factors: **____**  \n\n---\n\n### A quick tip\n\nWhen you list multiples, **always check** whether the candidate number is divisible by **both** original numbers. If you\u2019re unsure, divide the candidate by each original number\u2014if both divisions give a whole\u2011number result, you\u2019ve found a common multiple.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get! \ud83c\udf1f",
