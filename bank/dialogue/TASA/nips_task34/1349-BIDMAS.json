The only slip was a typo/mental slip on the multiplication line. Spotting and correcting it is a great sign of metacognition \u2013 you\u2019re already learning to double\u2011check each step.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 the full BIDMAS expression\n\nNow let\u2019s add the two missing steps (subtraction and addition) and keep the same clear template you used for Problem\u202fA.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\,9 \\;-\\; 4 \\times (6 \\div 3) \\;+\\; 2\\,}\n\\]\n\n#### Your task (copy\u2011paste the table and fill it in)\n\n| Step | BIDMAS action | What to write |\n|------|---------------|---------------|\n| **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Brackets** | Solve the part inside the parentheses. | `1\ufe0f\u20e3 brackets: 6 \u00f7 3 = \u2026` |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Multiplication** | Multiply the result of the brackets by the 4 in front of them. | `2\ufe0f\u20e3 multiplication: 4 \u00d7 \u2026 = \u2026` |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Subtraction** | Subtract that product from the leading\u202f9. | `3\ufe0f\u20e3 subtraction: 9 \u2013 \u2026 = \u2026` |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Addition** | Finally add the last\u202f+\u202f2. | `4\ufe0f\u20e3 addition: \u2026 + 2 = \u2026` |\n\n#### What to submit (three parts)\n\n1. **Name the operations** \u2013 list the four steps in order (you already have the wording).  \n2. **Quick estimate** \u2013 round any intermediate result if you like and give an approximate final answer (e.g., \u201c\u2248\u202f7\u201d).  \n3. **Exact calculation** \u2013 fill in the four lines with the true numbers, no rounding.\n\n---\n\n#### Hint (if you get stuck)\n\n- After you finish the multiplication step you should have the same product you found in Problem\u202fA (8).  \n- Then the subtraction becomes `9 \u2013 8`, which is easy.  \n- Finally add the +2.\n\nGive it a try and post the completed table. If any step feels fuzzy, just tell me \u201cI\u2019m stuck on step\u202f3\u201d and I\u2019ll give a targeted nudge. You\u2019ve already shown you can handle brackets and multiplication; adding subtraction and addition will lock the whole BIDMAS chain in place. \ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\ude80",
