That produces a triangle whose three sides are all about 6\u202fcm \u2013 an **equilateral** triangle \u2013 not the required isosceles triangle with sides 6\u202fcm,\u202f4\u202fcm,\u202f4\u202fcm.  \n\nSo the construction you produced is **incorrect for the given specifications**. The steps are otherwise sound; you just need the correct compass setting.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice \u2013 \u201cTry Again with the Right Radius\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s redo the same problem, but this time keep the compass set to the **required side length (4\u202fcm)**. Follow the steps, write a brief description in your own words, and record the three measured lengths.\n\n### Task\n\n1. **Draw the base**\u202fAB = **6\u202fcm** (use the ruler and write down the measured length).  \n2. **Set the compass** to **4\u202fcm** (measure the opening on the compass with the ruler and note the value).  \n3. **Draw the two arcs**:  \n   - Place the compass point on **A**, keep the 4\u202fcm opening, and draw an arc above (or below) AB.  \n   - Without changing the compass width, move the point to **B** and draw a second arc that intersects the first.  \n4. **Mark the intersection** of the arcs as **C** (choose either intersection if there are two).  \n5. **Connect** C to A and B with straight lines.  \n6. **Measure** the three sides **AB, AC, BC** and write the results.  \n\n### What to submit\n\n- A short, numbered description of what you did (you can copy the list above and add any personal notes).  \n- The three measured lengths (they should be close to 6\u202fcm, 4\u202fcm, and 4\u202fcm).  \n- If something feels off (e.g., the arcs don\u2019t meet, the compass slips), note the difficulty and how you tried to fix it.\n\n---\n\n**Why this helps**\n\n- Using the correct compass radius reinforces the idea that an *arc* represents *all points at a given distance* from a fixed point.  \n- Measuring the final sides gives immediate feedback: if the lengths aren\u2019t 6\u202fcm\u20114\u202fcm\u20114\u202fcm, you\u2019ll know the construction needs a tweak.  \n\nGive it a try, and let me know how the measurements turn out! \ud83d\ude80",

That part is fine; a small 1\u20112\u202fmm error in the base will not ruin the construction.\n\n2. **Compass opening** \u2013 The crucial step is setting the compass to **exactly** the length of the two equal sides (4\u202fcm).  \n   *You wrote that the opening might have been 4.5\u202fcm.*  \n   When the radius is larger than 4\u202fcm, the arcs intersect farther away from AB, so the segments **AC** and **BC** become longer than 4\u202fcm. That is why the triangle you measured is \u201clong and thin\u201d instead of the intended 6\u20114\u20114 shape.\n\n3. **Arcs and point C** \u2013 The procedure of drawing the two arcs and picking their intersection is correct; the only thing that determines where the intersection lands is the radius you used.\n\n4. **Checking the side lengths** \u2013 You only reported the base length. To verify the construction you need to measure **AC** and **BC** as well. If they are close to 4\u202fcm (within a millimetre or two), the construction is successful; if they are nearer to 5\u202fcm or 6\u202fcm, the compass was set too wide.\n\n**Bottom line:** The steps are right, but the compass was not set to the required 4\u202fcm. A small over\u2011opening (e.g., 4.5\u202fcm) makes both legs too long, giving you an almost\u2011equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice \u2013 \u201cFine\u2011tune the radius and verify\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll repeat the same problem, but this time we\u2019ll **lock** the compass opening so you can be sure it stays at 4\u202fcm while you draw both arcs.\n\n### What to do (write down what you actually did)\n\n1. **Draw the base**  \n   - Place the ruler, mark two points 6\u202fcm apart, and draw segment **AB**.  \n   - Write the measured length you obtain (e.g., 6.02\u202fcm).\n\n2. **Set and lock the compass**  \n   - Open the compass until the distance between the points of the legs reads **exactly 4.00\u202fcm** on the ruler.  \n   - If your compass has a screw or a \u201clocking\u201d knob, tighten it now so the opening cannot change while you move the compass.\n\n3. **Draw the two arcs**  \n   - With the point on **A**, swing an arc (above the line).  \n   - Without loosening the compass, move the point to **B** and swing the second arc so that it crosses the first one.\n\n4. **Mark point C** \u2013 Choose either of the two intersection points (the upper one is fine) and label it **C**.\n\n5. **Connect the sides** \u2013 Draw **AC** and **BC** with the straight\u2011edge.\n\n6. **Measure all three sides** \u2013 Using the ruler, record the lengths of **AB, AC,** and **BC** (to the nearest 0.1\u202fmm if you can).\n\n7. **Reflect** \u2013 If AC and BC are not close to 4\u202fcm, note what you think went wrong (e.g., compass slipped, opening changed,",

To know whether the construction succeeded you also need the lengths of **AC** and **BC**. Without those numbers we can\u2019t tell if the triangle you produced is the required 6\u20114\u20114 isosceles triangle or something else.\n\n**Bottom line:** Your steps are on the right track, but the key missing piece is a **precise 4\u202fcm compass setting** and the verification of the two equal sides. Let\u2019s focus on mastering that one skill before we redo the whole triangle.\n\n---\n\n## Next Practice \u2013 \u201cLock the 4\u202fcm radius and check it\u201d\n\n### Goal\nMake sure you can set the compass to **exactly 4\u202fcm** and confirm that the radius really is 4\u202fcm before you draw any arcs.\n\n### What to do (write down exactly what you did)\n\n1. **Place the ruler on a clean part of your paper.**  \n2. **Open the compass** so that the two legs are roughly 4\u202fcm apart.  \n3. **Measure the opening** with the ruler *from the tip of the pencil\u2011lead leg to the tip of the pointy leg*.  \n   - Write the measurement you see (e.g., 3.97\u202fcm, 4.02\u202fcm, \u2026).  \n4. **If your compass has a tightening screw or a \u201clocking\u201d knob, turn it now** so the opening cannot change while you move the compass.  \n5. **Draw a small circle** using that locked opening, with the point on the paper (you can label the centre **O**).  \n6. **Measure the diameter of the circle** (the straight\u2011line distance across the circle passing through the centre).  \n   - Write this measurement. It should be close to **8.00\u202fcm** (twice the radius).  \n7. **Reflect:**  \n   - If the radius you measured in step\u202f3 is not within \u00b10.1\u202fcm of 4\u202fcm, what do you think caused the error? (e.g., the compass slipped, the ruler was not aligned, the legs are loose.)  \n   - If the diameter you measured in step\u202f6 is not about 8\u202fcm, does that tell you the same thing?\n\n### What to submit\n\n- The measurement you read in step\u202f3 (radius).  \n- The measurement you read in step\u202f6 (diameter).  \n- A brief note (1\u20112 sentences) about any difficulty you noticed and how you tried to fix it.\n\n---\n\n**Why this helps**\n\n- Practising the *exact* setting isolates the single piece of information that was off in the previous attempt.  \n- Measuring the radius and then the diameter gives you two independent checks that the compass is truly at 4\u202fcm.  \n- Once you can lock the compass reliably, the subsequent triangle construction will automatically give you the correct side lengths.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know the numbers you obtain.

Follow the steps, then report the numbers asked for.\n\n#### What to do (write down exactly what you did)\n\n1. **Place a ruler on a clean part of the paper.**  \n2. **Open the compass roughly to 4\u202fcm** (the two legs should be about the length of the \u201c4\u2011cm\u201d tick on the ruler).  \n3. **Fine\u2011tune the opening:**  \n   - Hold the **pointy leg** (the one that will be the pivot) steady on the 0\u2011cm mark of the ruler.  \n   - Move the **pencil\u2011lead leg** until its tip lands exactly on the **4.0\u2011cm** mark.  \n   - **Check the alignment** from both sides of the ruler to be sure the tip is not a fraction past the mark.  \n4. **Lock the opening:**  \n   - Tighten the screw or \u201clocking knob\u201d **while you keep the legs in position**.  \n   - Give the legs a gentle wiggle; they should not move at all.  \n   - If they still slip, add a tiny piece of **masking tape** around the joint to hold it (remove the tape after you\u2019re done).  \n5. **Measure the radius again:**  \n   - Without moving the compass, place the ruler next to the legs and read the distance from tip\u2011to\u2011tip.  \n   - Write this measurement (to the nearest\u202f0.1\u202fmm).  \n6. **Draw a small test circle:**  \n   - Put the pivot point on the paper, draw a complete circle.  \n   - Using the ruler, measure the **diameter** (draw a straight line through the centre and read the distance).  \n   - Write this measurement.  \n7. **Reflect (1\u20132 sentences):**  \n   - Did the radius read exactly 4.0\u202fcm?  \n   - If not, what part of the locking process gave you trouble, and how did you try to",

Even if the pencil leg ends near \u201c4\u202fcm\u201d on the ruler, the actual opening is about **3\u202fcm** (or whatever the mis\u2011alignment was). |\n| **Reading the ruler** \u2013 you weren\u2019t sure whether the tip was at 3.9\u202fcm, 4.0\u202fcm or 4.2\u202fcm. | A \u00b10.2\u202fcm error already makes the radius 3.8\u202fcm\u202f\u2013\u202f4.2\u202fcm, which is enough to change the side lengths of the triangle you will draw. |\n| **Locking the screw** \u2013 the screw felt loose, you only gave it a quick twist, and the legs still wiggle. | A \u201cwiggly\u201d opening lets the compass drift while you draw the arcs, so the radius you thought you had is not the radius that actually gets used. |\n| **Skipping the tape trick** \u2013 you avoided a simple way to stop the slip. | Without an extra grip, a loose screw will continue to move, especially when you lift the compass off the paper. |\n\nBecause of these combined slips, the radius you ended up with was **not reliably 4\u202fcm**.  That\u2019s why the earlier triangle came out with sides longer than 4\u202fcm.

That\u2019s completely understandable \u2013 the \u201creference\u2011segment\u201d routine has a lot of tiny details, and it\u2019s easy to feel unsure about how to phrase them.  \n\nBecause the list is missing, we can\u2019t yet see whether you\u2019ve corrected the three problem areas we identified (starting the line at 0\u202fcm, aligning the compass legs tip\u2011to\u2011tip, and securing the screw with a wiggle test).  Once you spell out the exact steps, we\u2019ll be able to tell you precisely what still needs tightening.\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next question (tailored to your current state)**  \n\nWrite the complete procedure in **5\u20137 short bullet points**.  Each bullet should contain a concrete action, not a vague \u201cabout\u201d or \u201cmaybe\u201d.  Use the prompts below to guide you; you can combine them into a single list if you wish.\n\n1. **Place the ruler** \u2013 where do you line up the 0\u202fcm mark on the paper?  \n2. **Mark the endpoints** \u2013 which point will you call **P** and which **Q**?  State the exact positions (e.g., \u201cput the tip of the pencil at the 0\u202fcm mark, label that point\u202fP\u201d).  \n3. **Draw the reference segment** \u2013 describe how you join P and Q to make a 4\u202fcm line.  \n4. **Set the compass** \u2013 explain how you position the **sharp\u2011point leg** (pivot) on one endpoint and the **pencil\u2011lead leg** on the other, making sure the legs are tip\u2011to\u2011tip on P and Q.  \n5. **Lock the compass** \u2013 detail the screw\u2011tightening motion and the quick \u201cwiggle test\u201d you use to confirm the opening won\u2019t move.  \n6. *(optional)* **Check the radius** \u2013 describe a quick verification (e.g., measure the opened compass back onto the ruler or compare an arc to the reference line).  \n7. *(optional)* **Label the pivot and drawing leg** \u2013 restate which leg stays fixed and which draws the arcs.\n\n**Your task:** Write those bullets in plain sentences and paste them below.  When we see the concrete sequence, we\u2019ll pinpoint any remaining slips and you\u2019ll have a reliable \u201cscript\u201d to follow every time you need an exact 4\u202fcm radius.  \n\nGive it a try\u2014you\u2019re almost there! \ud83c\udf1f",

Write a new list that:\n\n1. Starts the ruler at the **0\u202fcm** mark on the left edge of the paper.  \n2. Labels the left\u2011hand endpoint **P** and the right\u2011hand endpoint **Q** (or the reverse \u2013 just stay consistent).  \n3. Draws a straight line **P\u2011Q** that is **exactly 4\u202fcm** long.  \n4. Places the **sharp\u2011point leg (pivot)** on one endpoint **and** the **pencil\u2011lead leg** on the other endpoint, making sure the legs touch the points *tip\u2011to\u2011tip*.  \n5. Tightens the compass screw until there is **no wiggle** (give a quick \u201cwiggle test\u201d to confirm).  \n6. *(optional)* Checks the radius by moving the opened compass back onto the ruler or by measuring one of the arcs against the reference segment.  \n\n**Your task:** Write those bullets in plain sentences, **using the correct labels and order**.
