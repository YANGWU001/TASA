Draw \\(AB = 6\\text{ cm}\\).  \n2. With the compass set to any convenient radius, place the needle at \\(A\\) and draw a \\(50^{\\circ}\\) angle using the protractor (or by constructing the angle with the compass).  \n3. With the same radius, place the needle at \\(B\\) and draw a \\(60^{\\circ}\\) angle.  \n4. Mark the intersection of the two rays as \\(C\\).  \n5. Draw segments \\(AC\\) and \\(BC\\).  \n\n---\n\n**Tip:** If the two rays do not intersect on the same side of \\(AB\\), flip one of the angles to the opposite side of the base \u2013 the triangle can be drawn on either side of the base.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, check that the three angles add up to \\(180^{\\circ}\\) (they should be \\(50^{\\circ}, 60^{\\circ},\\) and \\(70^{\\circ}\\)) and that the side \\(AB\\) is exactly 6\u202fcm.  \n\nGood luck! \ud83c\udf1f",
