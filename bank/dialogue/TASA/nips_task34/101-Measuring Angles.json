That inner arc measures **70\u00b0**, so the angle\u2019s measure is **70\u00b0**, not 110\u00b0. Because 70\u00b0 is less than 90\u00b0, the angle is **acute**.\n\n**Why the mistake happens**  \nWhen a protractor is used, the *inner* (smaller) arc always gives the smaller angle between the two sides. The larger \u201couter\u201d arc would give the reflex angle (360\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f70\u00b0\u202f=\u202f290\u00b0), and the straight\u2011line supplement (180\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f70\u00b0\u202f=\u202f110\u00b0) is not the angle you\u2019re measuring here.

At the point where **t** meets **\u2113\u2081**, the angle between **t** and **\u2113\u2081** on the lower\u2011right side measures **70\u00b0** (use a protractor to confirm).  \n\n**What is the measure of the corresponding angle on \u2113\u2082?**  \n\nA) 70\u00b0 \u2013 acute  \nB) 110\u00b0 \u2013 obtuse  \nC) 90\u00b0 \u2013 right  \nD) 180\u00b0 \u2013 straight  \n\n*(Select the best answer.)*  \n\n---\n\n**Why this question?**  \n- It reinforces the basic angle\u2011measurement skill you just practiced (reading a 70\u00b0 angle).  \n- It introduces the **corresponding\u2011angles** rule for parallel lines, a concept you\u2019re also working on.  \n- Because your forgetting score is very low, you still have the earlier knowledge fresh, so adding the parallel\u2011line context gives a gentle stretch without overwhelming you.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know which choice you think is correct! \ud83d\ude80",

They are **not** the angles that are diagonally opposite across the two parallel lines. |\n\nThe\u202f70\u00b0 you measured at the first intersection (\u2113\u2081) is a **corresponding** angle to the lower\u2011right angle at the second intersection (\u2113\u2082). Because \u2113\u2081\u202f\u2225\u202f\u2113\u2082, the corresponding angle **must also be 70\u00b0**.  \n\nThe \u201cstraight\u2011line\u201d idea does **not** apply here, because the lower\u2011right angle does **not** share a side with the upper\u2011left angle in a straight line; they are diagonal corners of the \u201cX\u201d formed by the transversal and the parallel lines.\n\n**Therefore the correct choice is A)\u202f70\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202facute.**  \nYou were on the right track thinking about relationships between angles\u2014just remember which relationship (corresponding vs. supplementary) is being used.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 \u201cSame size, different place\u201d (a tiny stretch)**  \n\nNow that the *corresponding\u2011angle* rule is solid, let\u2019s blend it with the *alternate\u2011interior* rule.
