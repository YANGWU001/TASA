The *y*\u2011value never changes when you reflect across the y\u2011axis. |\n\n**Correct answer:** \\((2,5)\\)\n\n> **Rule reminder** \u2013 *y\u2011axis*: \\((x,y) \\rightarrow (-x,\\,y)\\)  \n> *x\u2011axis*: \\((x,y) \\rightarrow (x,\\,-y)\\)  \n> *origin*: \\((x,y) \\rightarrow (-x,\\,-y)\\)\n\nYou were close! You remembered that one coordinate flips, but it was the wrong one. No problem \u2013 that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re practicing the y\u2011axis rule a bit more.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 \u201ccombine y\u2011axis with another reflection\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s add a second step so you can see how the rules *chain* together.  \nWork **step\u2011by\u2011step**, writing each intermediate point before moving on to the next reflection.\n\n| # | Starting point\u202f\\(P\\) | Reflection(s) (in order) | Your work (list each step) | Final answer |\n|---|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| **B** | \\((4,\\,-3)\\) | **x\u2011axis \u2192 y\u2011axis** |  |  |\n\n#### How to solve it  \n\n1. **First reflection \u2013 x\u2011axis**  \n   *Rule*: keep *x*, flip *y*.  \n   \\((4,-3) \\;\\longrightarrow\\; (4,\\; \\color{blue}{+3}) = (4,3)\\)\n\n2. **Second reflection \u2013 y\u2011axis**  \n   *Rule*: keep *y*, flip *x*.  \n   \\((4,3) \\;\\longrightarrow\\; (\\color{blue}{-4},\\;3) = (-4,3)\\)\n\n3. **Final answer** is the point after the second step: **\\((-4,3)\\)**.\n\n---\n\n#### Your turn\n\n1. Write the intermediate point after the **x\u2011axis** step.  \n2. Write the intermediate point after the **y\u2011axis** step (which will also be the final answer).  \n3. Fill in the \u201cFinal answer\u201d column.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve completed row\u202fB, let me know\u2014then we\u2019ll move on to the next two problems (C and D) that involve the origin reflection. Keep using the \u201clist each step\u201d habit; it\u2019s the fastest way to avoid skipping a flip. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nYou\u2019ve already mastered the x\u2011axis rule, and now you\u2019re just polishing the y\u2011axis rule. You\u2019re doing great\u2014keep it up! \ud83d\ude80",
