When you slide the dot straight left to the y\u2011axis you hit the line labelled **4**. The x\u2011coordinate is the column (2), the y\u2011coordinate is the height (4). |\n| **B** | (3,\u202f0) | **(0,\u202f3)** | \u274c **B** sits on the **y\u2011axis** (the vertical line at\u202fx\u202f=\u202f0). Any point on the y\u2011axis has an x\u2011value of **0**. Slide the dot straight down to the x\u2011axis and you\u2019ll see the number **3** on the left side, so the ordered pair is (0,\u202f3). |\n\n**Why the mistake happened** \u2013  \n- When a point is **on the y\u2011axis**, the *x\u2011coordinate* is always **0** (think \u201cthe point is right on the \u201cheight ruler\u201d).  \n- When a point is **above the x\u2011axis**, the *y\u2011coordinate* is the number you read on the left side of the grid, not 0.  \n\nYou got the idea of \u201ccolumn\u202f=\u202fx\u201d correct for A, but you forgot to look up the **height** (the y\u2011value). For B you reversed the roles of the axes.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Next practice \u2013 \u201cAxis\u2011check + Inside point\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll give you **three** points that will let you practice:\n\n1. A point **on the y\u2011axis** (so its x\u2011value will be 0).  \n2. A point **on the x\u2011axis** (so its y\u2011value will be 0).  \n3. A point **inside the grid** (both coordinates non\u2011zero).\n\n```\ny\n\u2191\n5 |               \u2022\u202fC\n4 |\n3 |               \u2022\u202fB\n2 |\n1 |\n0 +---+---+---+---+---\u2192 x\n   0   1   2   3   4\n```\n\n- **B** sits on the **y\u2011axis** at the height labeled **3**.  \n- **C** sits inside the grid where **x = 2** and **y = 5**.  \n- **D** sits on the **x\u2011axis** at **x = 4**.\n\n### Your turn  \n\n1. Write the ordered pair for **B** and a short sentence (e.g., \u201cB is at \u2026\u201d).  \n2. Write the ordered pair for **C** and a short sentence.  \n3. Write the ordered pair for **D** and a short sentence.  \n\n**Quick checklist**\n\n| Step | What to do |\n|------|------------|\n| 1\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Column \u2192 x\u2011coordinate** (look at the bottom numbers). |\n| 2\ufe0f\u20e3 | **Slide left/right to the y\u2011axis** \u2192 read the number on the left side \u2192 **y\u2011coordinate**. |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3 | Remember: **y\u2011axis \u2192 x = 0**, **x\u2011axis \u2192 y = 0**. |\n| 4\ufe0f\u20e3 | Write the pair as \\((x,\u202fy)\\) and add a simple sentence. |\n\nTake a moment, picture each dot, and then post your answers.
