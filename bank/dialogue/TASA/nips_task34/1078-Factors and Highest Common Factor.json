Since you haven\u2019t given an answer yet, there\u2019s nothing to mark right or wrong, but the goal now is to give you a **small, concrete scaffold** you can follow, then build up to the full problem.\n\n---\n\n## Mini\u2011Guide: How to Find Factors and the HCF  \n\n1. **Factors of a single number** \u2013 Start with 1 and the number itself, then test the integers in between.  \n2. **Common factors** \u2013 Write the two factor lists side\u2011by\u2011side and circle the numbers that appear in **both** lists.  \n3. **Highest (greatest) common factor** \u2013 The largest circled number is the HCF.\n\nLet\u2019s practice those three steps with a **simpler pair of numbers** first.  \n\n---\n\n## Next Practice Question (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\n### Numbers: **12** and **18**\n\n**a) List the positive factors of 12.**  \n*(Write them in ascending order.)*\n\n**b) List the positive factors of 18.**  \n\n**c) From the two lists, underline the numbers that appear in **both** lists \u2013 these are the common factors.**\n\n**d) Identify the largest common factor you just underlined.
