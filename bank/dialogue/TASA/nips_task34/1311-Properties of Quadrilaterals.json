Below are three common types of quadrilaterals.\u202fSelect the one that **always** satisfies **all** of the listed properties.\n\n| Quadrilateral | Properties it must have |\n|---------------|--------------------------|\n| **A. Rectangle** | 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Opposite sides are equal.<br>2\ufe0f\u20e3 All interior angles are 90\u00b0.<br>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Diagonals are equal in length. |\n| **B. Rhombus**   | 1\ufe0f\u20e3 All four sides are equal.<br>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Opposite angles are equal.<br>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Diagonals are perpendicular. |\n| **C. Parallelogram** | 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Opposite sides are parallel.<br>2\ufe0f\u20e3 Opposite sides are equal.<br>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Consecutive angles are supplementary (add to 180\u00b0). |\n\n**Which letter (A,\u202fB, or\u202fC) correctly matches a quadrilateral that *always* has **all three** of its listed properties?**  \n\n*(If you\u2019re unsure, try to recall the most basic definition of each shape before choosing.)*  \n\n---  \n\n**Answer (for you to check after you\u2019ve tried):**  \n\n**A. Rectangle** \u2013 Every rectangle must have opposite sides equal, all interior angles 90\u00b0, and equal diagonals. The other two shapes may sometimes have some of those features, but not all three simultaneously.  \n\n---  \n\n*Why this question?*  \n- It asks you to retrieve **one key property** for each familiar quadrilateral.  \n- It\u2019s deliberately simple so you can rebuild confidence before moving on to more detailed property lists (e.g., angle sums, side\u2011parallel relationships, diagonal behavior).  \n\nWhen you\u2019re comfortable with this, we\u2019ll add a second question that asks you to **list** the properties of a specific quadrilateral (e.g., \u201cWrite all properties that define a square\u201d).
