Visualize (or sketch) the described \u201cT\u201d.  \n2. Think about how a mirror placed along each candidate line would reflect the shape.  \n3. Pick the letter (A, B, C, or D) that correctly identifies a line of symmetry.\n\n---\n\n*Why this question is a good starting point:*  \n- It uses a familiar, simple shape (the letter \u201cT\u201d).  \n- It focuses on the two most common symmetry lines (vertical and horizontal) before moving to more complex diagonals.  \n- It lets you demonstrate the basic idea of \u201cmirroring\u201d without requiring you to draw or manipulate the shape.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, let me know which answer you chose and why, and we\u2019ll discuss it together!",

Every point on one side has a matching point on the other side.\n\nSo the correct answer is **A) the vertical line**. Great effort!
