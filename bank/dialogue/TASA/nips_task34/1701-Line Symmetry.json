Imagine drawing a straight line through the shape:  \n   * **Vertical line of symmetry** \u2013 the line goes up\u2011and\u2011down, dividing the shape into left\u2011right mirror images.  \n   * **Horizontal line of symmetry** \u2013 the line goes left\u2011and\u2011right, dividing the shape into top\u2011bottom mirror images.  \n4. Mark the option that matches what you see.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, write your selections (e.g., \u201c1\u202f\u2013\u202fVertical, 2\u202f\u2013\u202fBoth, 3\u202f\u2013\u202fVertical\u201d).  \n\n*This question is designed to check your current ability to recognise simple vertical and horizontal symmetry, building on the practice you\u2019ve already done.*",

If you draw a line straight down the middle, the left side matches the right side. It does **not** match top\u2011to\u2011bottom, so there is no horizontal line of symmetry. |\n| **2 \u2013 Equilateral triangle (base down)** | **Horizontal** | **Vertical** | The triangle can be split by a line that runs from the top vertex straight down to the midpoint of the base. The left half mirrors the right half. A horizontal line would cut the triangle into two unequal halves, so it\u2019s not a line of symmetry. |\n| **3 \u2013 Tall rectangle** | **Both** | **Both** | A rectangle (even a \u201ctall\u201d one) has two lines of symmetry: one vertical down the middle and one horizontal across the middle. Your answer is spot\u2011on! |\n\n**Bottom line:** 2\u202fout of\u202f3 answers were incorrect, but you got the rectangle right.
