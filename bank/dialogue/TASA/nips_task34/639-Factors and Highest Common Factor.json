Start by testing the small integers 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026 up to the number itself to see which divide evenly.  \n2. Write the complete factor sets side by side.  \n3.

If the division leaves **remainder\u202f0**, write the integer down.  \n3. **Remember** that every number is at least divisible by 1 and by itself, and often by a \u201cmid\u2011range\u201d number (e.g., 24 \u00f7\u202f6 =\u202f4, so 6 is a factor).  \n4. **Check in pairs**: if *a* divides the number, then *number\u202f\u00f7\u202fa* is also a factor. For 24, when you find 4, you automatically know 24\u202f\u00f7\u202f4\u202f=\u202f6 is another factor.\n\nGive it a try on paper or in the chat, and when you\u2019re ready paste your lists (or just the final HCF) back to me. I\u2019ll give you quick feedback and then we\u2019ll move on to a slightly different method (prime\u2011factorisation) to find HCFs without writing out every factor.\n\nYou\u2019re doing great\u2014keep the momentum! \ud83d\ude80",

Whenever you\u2019re unsure, use the \u201cpair\u2011rule\u201d: if *a* divides the number, then *number \u00f7 a* is also a factor. That helps you spot the middle numbers quickly.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 building confidence with a new method  \n\nNow that you can list factors reliably, let\u2019s learn a **faster way** to find the HCF using **prime factorisation**. This avoids writing out every factor, which becomes handy with larger numbers.\n\n#### \ud83d\udcd8 Quick reminder \u2013 Prime factorisation  \n* A **prime number** has no divisors other than\u202f1 and itself (2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u2026).  \n* To **prime\u2011factorise** a number, keep breaking it down until only primes remain.  \n* The HCF is the product of the primes that appear in **both** factorizations, using the **lowest exponent** each time.\n\n#### \ud83c\udf1f Your new problem  \n\n**a)** Write the prime factorisation of **36**.  \n**b)** Write the prime factorisation of **48**.  \n**c)** Using those factorizations, determine the **highest common factor (HCF)** of 36 and 48.  \n**d) (optional)** Explain in one sentence why the number you found is the HCF.\n\n#### How to do it  \n\n1. **Factor 36**  \n   - Start with the smallest prime that divides it (2).  \n   - Keep dividing: 36 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f18, 18 \u00f7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f9 (now 9 is not divisible by\u202f2).  \n   - Move to the next prime (3): 9 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f3, 3 \u00f7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f1.  \n   - Write the result as powers of primes: **36\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u00b2",

It\u2019s normal to feel a little stuck the first time you see a new method. The good news is you already know how to list factors, so the same idea (finding what numbers divide evenly) works here \u2013 just with **prime numbers only**. Let\u2019s break it down together. |\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 step\u2011by\u2011step prime factorisation**\n\nWe\u2019ll tackle the same three\u2011part problem, but I\u2019ll give you a tiny prompt for each step. Write just the answer for each prompt before moving on.\n\n---\n\n### a) Prime factorisation of **36**\n\n1. **Find the smallest prime that divides 36.**  \n   *Hint:* 2 is the smallest prime; does 36 \u00f7\u202f2 leave a remainder?  \n\n2. **Divide repeatedly by that prime until it no longer works.**  \n   Write each division result.\n\n3. **When you can\u2019t divide by 2 any more, move to the next prime (3).**  \n   Continue until the final quotient is 1.\n\n4. **Write the result as a product of primes using exponents** (e.g., \\(2^a \\cdot 3^b\\)).  \n\n*Your turn:*  \n- Smallest prime divisor of 36?  \n- After dividing by 2 twice, what\u2019s left?  \n- Which prime divides the remainder?  \n- What is the final prime\u2011factorisation of 36?\n\n---\n\n### b) Prime factorisation of **48**\n\nRepeat the same four\u2011step routine for 48.\n\n*Your turn:*  \n- Smallest prime divisor of 48?  \n- How many times can you divide by that prime?  \n- What\u2019s the next prime you need?  \n- Write the final factorisation of 48.\n\n---\n\n### c) Find the HCF using the factorizations\n\n1. **List the primes that appear in **both** factorizations** and note their exponents.  \n2. **For each common prime, keep the *smaller* exponent**.  \n3. **Multiply those kept prime powers together** \u2013 that product is the HCF.\n\n*Your turn:*  \n- Which primes are common to the two factorizations you just wrote?  \n- What are the smallest exponents for each common prime?  \n- What number do you get when you multiply those together?\n\n---\n\n### d) (optional) Explain in one sentence why that number is the HCF.\n\n*Example:* \u201cIt is the product of all prime factors that both numbers share, using the lowest power each appears with, so no larger common divisor can exist.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**What to do now**\n\n1. Answer the four prompts for **36**.  \n2. Answer the four prompts for **48**.  \n3. Use those results to write the HCF and (optionally) the short explanation.\n\nWhen you send me your work, I\u2019ll give you quick feedback and then we\u2019ll move on to a slightly different shortcut (the Euclidean algorithm) for finding HCFs without any factorisation at all. You\u2019ve already proved you can list factors correctly, so this new method will become a handy tool in your math toolbox. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nGive it a try\u2014one small step at a time!
