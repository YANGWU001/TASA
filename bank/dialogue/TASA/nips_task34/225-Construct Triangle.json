Great start\u2014keep going!\n\n---\n\n## Next practice question (tailored to your current state)\n\nBecause you\u2019re still solidifying the \u201cconstruct an angle\u201d and \u201clay off given lengths\u201d steps, the next problem will let you rehearse those skills with a **different angle** and **different side lengths**. The geometry is the same, but the numbers change, which helps reinforce the procedure.\n\n---\n\n### Practice Question \u2013 Construct a Triangle (new data)\n\nUsing only a ruler, a compass, and a straight\u2011edge (no protractor), construct **\u0394PQR** that satisfies:\n\n- **PQ = 4\u202fcm**\n- **PR = 6\u202fcm**\n- **\u2220QPR = 45\u00b0**\n\n#### What to do\n\n1. **Draw the given angle** \u2013 Start at point **P** and construct a 45\u00b0 angle to obtain ray **PR**.\n2. **Mark the side lengths** \u2013 From **P**, lay off **PQ = 4\u202fcm** on one ray and **PR = 6\u202fcm** on the other ray.\n3. **Complete the triangle** \u2013 Connect the two endpoints (**Q** and **R**) to form side **QR**.\n\n#### Show your work\n\n- Sketch the construction on a clean sheet.\n- Label all points, lengths, and the angle.\n- List the sequence of steps you used (e.g., \u201cConstruct 45\u00b0 angle with compass\u2026\u201d, \u201cSet compass to 4\u202fcm and draw arc on ray\u202fPQ\u2026\u201d, etc.).\n\n#### Hint for the 45\u00b0 angle\n\n1. Draw a circle centered at **P** with any convenient radius.\n2. Pick a point **X** on the circle.  \n3. With the same radius, draw a second circle centered at **X**; let it intersect the first circle at **Y**.\n4. Triangle **PXY** is an isosceles right triangle, so **\u2220XPY = 45\u00b0**. Use ray **PY** as the second side of the angle.\n\n---\n\n**Why this helps:**  \n- You\u2019ll practice the *equilateral\u2011triangle* trick you just learned (for 60\u00b0) and a *right\u2011isosceles* trick (for 45\u00b0).  \n- You\u2019ll repeat the \u201cset\u2011compass\u2011to\u2011given\u2011length \u2192 swing an arc\u201d step, which is the core of the \u201cConstruct Triangle\u201d skill you\u2019re building.\n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re done post your steps (or any question you hit).

Then we make another arc with centre\u202fE (or\u202fF) that meets the first one at a point\u202fG. Finally we **draw the line CG**; that line is supposed to be the bisector of\u202f\u2220PCD.  \n\n*Justification:* because the two arcs give us equal distances from the sides of the angle, the line\u202fCG\u202fsplits the angle into two equal parts \u2013 so each part is\u202f45\u00b0 (since the original angle is a right angle).  \n\n---\n\n**Step\u202f6 \u2013 Complete the construction**  \n\nI guess the next step is to **extend the ray CG** until it meets the circle\u202f\u0393\u2082 at a point\u202fH.

The missing piece is the **size** of the original angle: by Thales, because PD is a diameter of \u0393\u2081, \u2220PCD = 90\u00b0.

You do **not** need to draw the extra segments HP and HD for the 45\u00b0 claim; the bisector alone already guarantees the required angle with the given line \u2113 (which is the line PD). | \u2705\u202fMostly correct, but the justification can be tightened: the 45\u00b0 comes directly from the bisected right angle, not from an isosceles triangle. |\n| **Overall** | You have the right construction steps; just make the logical chain explicit:  <br>1\ufe0f\u20e3 PD is a diameter \u21d2 \u2220PCD = 90\u00b0 (Thales). <br>2\ufe0f\u20e3 CG (or CH) bisects that right angle \u21d2 each part = 45\u00b0. <br>3\ufe0f\u20e3 Because the ray passes through H on \u0393\u2082, the line **CH** (or its extension) is the required 45\u00b0 line. | \u2705\u202fGood, with a small polishing needed. |\n\n### What to remember for the next step",
