The next step is just to apply it consistently.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fYour next practice \u2013 a fresh setting, a little more support  \n\n> **Problem**  \n> In a **parallelogram** \\(ABCD\\) the measure of \\(\\angle B\\) is \\(65^\\circ\\).  \n> Which of the following statements is **always true**? (Choose **one** and give a one\u2011sentence justification.)\n\n| Choice | Statement |\n|--------|-----------|\n| **A** | \\(\\angle D = 65^\\circ\\) |\n| **B** | \\(\\angle C = 115^\\circ\\) |\n| **C** | \\(\\angle A = 65^\\circ\\) |\n| **D** | \\(\\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ\\) |\n\n#### How to solve it (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\n1. **Draw a quick sketch** \u2013 label the vertices in order \\(A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow D \\rightarrow A\\).  \n2. **Find the opposite angle** to \\(\\angle B\\).  Remember: opposite = two steps around the shape.  \n   * From \\(B\\) go to \\(C\\) (one step) and then to **\\(D\\)** (second step).  \n   * So the angle opposite \\(\\angle B\\) is **\\(\\angle D\\)**.  \n3. **Find the adjacent angles** to \\(\\angle B\\).  These are the ones one step away: **\\(\\angle A\\)** and **\\(\\angle C\\)**.  \n4. **Apply the two rules**:  \n   * *Opposite angles are equal* \u2192 \\(\\angle D = \\angle B = 65^\\circ\\).  \n   * *Adjacent angles are supplementary* \u2192 \\(\\angle B + \\angle A = 180^\\circ\\) **and** \\(\\angle B + \\angle C = 180^\\circ\\).  \n5. **Choose the statement that must hold for every parallelogram** with \\(\\angle B = 65^\\circ\\).  \n\nWrite the letter you think is correct **and** a short sentence like \u201cBecause opposite angles are equal, \\(\\angle D = 65^\\circ\\).\u201d\n\n---\n\n#### If you get stuck, try this hint  \n\n- **Opposite** = the vertex you reach after moving **two** places around the shape.  \n- **Adjacent** = the vertices you reach after moving **one** place.\n\nGive it a try and let me know which letter you chose (or which step is confusing).
