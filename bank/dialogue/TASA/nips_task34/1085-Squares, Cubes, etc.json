Find the length of each edge of the cube.  \n\n**Instructions:**  \n- Write the equation \\(6s^{2}=150\\).  \n- Show each algebraic step (division, square\u2011root).  \n- State the final answer with the correct unit.\n\n*Give it a try and write out the steps. If you get stuck at any point, let me know which step you\u2019re unsure about, and I\u2019ll walk through it with you.*\n\n---\n\n## What comes next?\n\nOnce you\u2019re comfortable solving for the edge length, we\u2019ll move on to a **substitution\u2011into\u2011formula** problem that combines both squares and cubes:\n\n> **Next question (preview):**  \n> A rectangular prism has a length that is twice its width and a height equal to the width. Its volume is \\(432\\ \\text{cm}^3\\). Find the dimensions of the prism.  \n> *(You\u2019ll use the volume formula \\(V = \\ell \\times w \\times h\\) and substitute the relationships between the sides.)*\n\nWe\u2019ll tackle that together after you finish the cube\u2011surface\u2011area problem.
