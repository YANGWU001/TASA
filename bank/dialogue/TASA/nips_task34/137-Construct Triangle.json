(If the arcs intersect in two points, choose either one; both give a valid triangle.)\n\n5. **Complete the triangle**  \n   - Use the straight\u2011edge to draw segments **AC** and **BC**.\n\n6. **Check your work** (optional, but good practice)  \n   - Measure **AC** and **BC** with the ruler to confirm they are **7\u202fcm** and **6\u202fcm**, respectively.  \n   - Verify that **AB** is still **5\u202fcm**.\n\n---\n\n### How to answer\n\n- **Sketch** the construction on a piece of paper (or describe each step in words if you\u2019re doing it mentally).  \n- **List the steps** you followed, just as the numbered outline above.  \n- **State the final result**: \u201cTriangle\u202fABC with sides AB\u202f=\u202f5\u202fcm, BC\u202f=\u202f6\u202fcm, AC\u202f=\u202f7\u202fcm has been constructed.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**What this question assesses**\n\n- Understanding of the **SSS (side\u2011side\u2011side) construction** method.  \n- Ability to set the compass to a given length and keep that length constant while moving the compass.  \n- Recognizing where the two arcs intersect to locate the third vertex.  \n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re done, let me know how the construction went or post any part you found tricky\u2014I'll help you refine the steps!",
