About your last response**\n\nYou wrote *\u201cI\u2019m not sure how to answer this.\u201d* \u2013 that\u2019s perfectly okay!  \nIt tells me you\u2019re aware that you need a method, but you haven\u2019t yet decided which one to use (prime\u2011factorisation or the Euclidean algorithm) or how to carry it out.\u202fThe important step now is to choose a systematic approach and follow it step\u2011by\u2011step.  \n\n**2. Quick reminder of the two ways you can find the HCF**\n\n| Method | How it works (short version) |\n|--------|------------------------------|\n| **Prime\u2011factorisation** | 1. Write each number as a product of prime factors.<br>2. Identify the primes that appear in **both** factorizations.<br>3. Multiply those common primes (using the smallest exponent each appears with). |\n| **Euclidean algorithm** (division method) | 1. Divide the larger number by the smaller.<br>2. Keep the remainder.<br>3. Replace the larger number with the smaller one and the smaller with the remainder.<br>4. Repeat until the remainder is\u202f0. The last non\u2011zero remainder is the HCF. |\n\nBoth give the same answer; the Euclidean algorithm is usually faster for larger numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s try a *guided* walk\u2011through (you can stop after the first step if you\u2019d rather finish on your own)\n\n**Step\u202f1 \u2013 Choose a method**  \nPick the one you feel most comfortable with. If you\u2019re not sure, try the Euclidean algorithm \u2013 it only needs division.\n\n**Step\u202f2 \u2013 Apply it to 84 and 126**  \n1. 126 \u00f7\u202f84 = 1 remainder **42**  \n2. 84 \u00f7\u202f42 = 2 remainder **0**  \n\nWhen the remainder becomes 0, the divisor from the previous step (here **42**) is the HCF.\n\n*If you prefer the prime\u2011factor method, you would write:*  \n84\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u202f\u00b7\u202f7  \n126\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f7  \nCommon primes: 2\u00b9,\u202f3\u00b9,\u202f7\u00b9 \u2192 HCF\u202f=\u202f2\u00b73\u00b77\u202f=\u202f42.\n\n**Your turn:** Write out the steps in your notebook, decide which method you used, and state the HCF. (You can check the answer below if you get stuck.)  \n\n> **Answer key:** HCF\u202f=\u202f**42**  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Next practice question (building on today\u2019s work)\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen how the Euclidean algorithm works, let\u2019s practice it with a slightly different pair of numbers.  \n\n**Practice Question \u2013 Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nFind the **Highest Common Factor** of **135** and **225** using the division (Euclidean) method.  \n\n*Show each division step and the remainder, then state the HCF.*\n\n---\n\n### What to watch for\n\n- Always divide the **larger** number by the **smaller** one.  \n- The remainder becomes the new divisor in the next step.  \n- Stop when the remainder is\u202f0; the last non\u2011zero remainder is the HCF.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know how it goes or where you get stuck. You\u2019re doing great\u2014keep practicing the step\u2011by\u2011step process, and the method will become second nature! \ud83d\ude80",
