The only thing missing is the actual addition and the \u201ccarry\u2011over\u201d hour that results from it. Since you didn\u2019t give a numeric answer yet, there\u2019s nothing to mark right or wrong; you\u2019re simply at the point where you need to finish the calculation.\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s move forward step\u2011by\u2011step  \n\n#### \ud83d\ude82 Train\u2011time problem  \n1. **Add the minutes** \u2013 What is \\(50+55\\)?  \n2. **Convert the total minutes** \u2013 Write that sum as \u201chours\u202f+\u202fminutes\u201d (e.g., 105\u202fmin = 1\u202fhour\u202f45\u202fmin).  \n3. **Add the hours** \u2013 Starting from 2\u202fPM, add  \n   - the 1\u202fhour that belongs to the travel time, and  \n   - the extra hour you just carried from the minutes.  \n   (If you pass 12, remember to switch from\u202fPM\u202fto\u202fAM or wrap around.)  \n\n> **Your task now:** Write the result of step\u202f1 (the minute sum) and state the \u201chour\u202f+\u202fminute\u201d form you get.\n\n#### \u2797 Sign\u2011operation problem  \n1. Compute \\((-12) \u00f7 4\\).  \n2. Take that quotient and multiply it by \\((-3)\\).  \n\n> **Your task now:** Give the answer to the first division.\n\n---\n\n### Why this helps  \n- **Breaking the problem into tiny pieces** reduces the chance of getting stuck, just like you successfully did when you added 45\u202fminutes earlier.  \n- **Seeing the intermediate result** (the minute sum and the first division) lets you check each step before moving on, reinforcing the \u201ccarry\u2011over\u201d idea and the sign rules for multiplication/division.\n\nGive those two short calculations a try, and then we\u2019ll finish the rest together. You\u2019ve already shown you can handle each piece\u2014just take it one step at a time! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n*(If any step feels fuzzy, let me know and I\u2019ll give a quick hint.)*",
