What we need now is a **short, concrete answer** to the two prompts I gave you: the points that define the 50\u00b0 ray, and the three points you would use to erect the 60\u00b0 angle at\u202fB.  Once you give those, we can check them together and move on. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nYou haven\u2019t yet supplied the specific points, so we can\u2019t confirm them.

We designated that fresh letter **J**. \u274c |\n| 3\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f (ray that reproduces the 70\u00b0 angle) | **H** | **J** | The ray must go from the original vertex\u202fC to the outside\u2011intersection point we just named. Since that point is **J**, the ray is **C\u202f\u2192\u202fJ**. \u274c |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- You correctly identified the first base point (**I**).  \n- The outside\u2011intersection point should be **J**, not **H**, and the ray is **C\u202f\u2192\u202fJ**.  \n\nYou\u2019re doing great at keeping the first step straight; now we just need to keep the \u201cnew\u2011letter\u201d rule clear for the outside point.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 \u201cName the outside point (with a visual cue)\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll do another copy\u2011an\u2011angle construction, but this time I\u2019ll give you a tiny picture\u2011description to help you see which point is \u201coutside\u201d.\n\n### Situation\nYou must copy a **45\u00b0** angle at vertex **P** onto the same base line **DE**.  \nYou will introduce three brand\u2011new letters: **L**, **M**, and **N**.\n\n### Sketch description (imagine the picture)\n\n1. **Arc\u202f1**: Center\u202fP, radius\u202fr. It cuts line\u202fDE at a point **L** (the *first* intersection, closer to the left\u2011hand side of the line).  \n2. **Arc\u202f2**: Same radius\u202fr, centered at **L**. It meets the first arc **outside** the segment DE at a point **M** (the intersection that lies **above** the line, not between D and E).  \n3. The ray that reproduces the 45\u00b0 angle is the line **P\u202f\u2192\u202fM**.\n\n### Fill\u2011in\u2011the\u2011blanks\n\n1. The first arc from **P** meets DE at point **_____** (call it *L*).  \n2. The second arc centered at **L** meets the first arc outside the segment at point **_____** (call it *M*).  \n3. The ray that copies the 45\u00b0 angle is **P\u202f\u2192\u202f_____**.\n\n#### Tiny hint\n- The *outside* point is always the one **not on the line DE**; it sits above (or below) the line where the two equal\u2011radius arcs cross.  \n- It must be a **new** letter that hasn\u2019t been used for any earlier construction (so it can\u2019t be I, J, E, H, etc.).\n\n---\n\n**Your turn:** Write the three missing letters (e.g., \u201cL,\u202fM,\u202fM\u201d). If any step feels fuzzy, just let me know which part you\u2019d like a quick visual reminder on, and I\u2019ll walk you through it step\u2011by\u2011step.
