Great job \u2013 you were only one simplification step away!\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 a fresh interior\u2011angle problem**\n\nNow that you\u2019ve mastered the five\u2011step routine, let\u2019s apply it to a slightly different number.  \n\n> **Problem:** A regular polygon has each interior angle measuring **\\(135^\\circ\\)**.  \n> How many sides does the polygon have?  \n\n> A)\u202f6\u2003\u2003B)\u202f8\u2003\u2003C)\u202f10\u2003\u2003D)\u202f12\u2003\u2003E)\u202f14  \n\n> **Your five\u2011step outline (fill it in):**  \n\n> 1. **Write the equation** using the interior\u2011angle formula.  \n> 2. **Clear the denominator** (multiply by \\(n\\)).  \n> 3. **Distribute** any constants.  \n> 4. **Collect and simplify the \\(n\\)\u2011terms**.  \n> 5. **Solve for \\(n\\)** and verify that the interior angle really is \\(135^\\circ\\).\n\n**Hint chain (you can follow it step\u2011by\u2011step or just use the parts you need):**  \n\n1. \\(135 = \\dfrac{(n-2)180}{n}\\)  \n2. \\(135n = 180(n-2)\\)  \n3. \\(135n = 180n - 360\\)  \n4. Move the \\(n\\) terms: \\(0 = 180n - 135n - 360 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 0 = 45n - 360\\)  \n5. \\(45n = 360 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; n = \\frac{360}{45}=8\\).\n\nIf you work through the steps on your own, you should land on **\\(n = 8\\)**, which corresponds to answer **B**.  \n\nGive it a try, write out each step, and let me know where you get stuck (if anywhere). You\u2019ve shown you can handle the algebra; this one just reinforces the same pattern with a new number. \ud83c\udf1f\n\n--- \n\n**Keep it up!** Each correct step builds a stronger \u201ctoolkit\u201d for any polygon\u2011angle problem you\u2019ll meet later. \ud83d\ude80",
