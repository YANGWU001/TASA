(Recall that two angles are supplementary when they add up to 180\u00b0.)  \n> 3. **If a protractor is placed at point B with its baseline aligned with AB,** what reading would you see at the tip of ray BC?\n\n---\n\n### Expected Answers\n\n1. **Acute** (because 30\u00b0\u202f<\u202f90\u00b0).  \n2. **150\u00b0** (since 180\u00b0\u202f\u2212\u202f30\u00b0\u202f=\u202f150\u00b0).  \n3. The protractor would read **30\u00b0** at the tip of ray BC.  \n\n---\n\n**Why this question is appropriate:**  \n\n- It reinforces the basic fact that a 30\u00b0 angle is acute.  \n- It practices the concept of supplementary angles, linking measurement to angle relationships.  \n- It asks the student to visualize using a protractor, building the skill of \u201creading\u201d an angle directly.  \n\nFeel free to draw the sketch on paper or use a physical protractor to check your answer for part\u202f3!",
