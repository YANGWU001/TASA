Corresponding angle** | When two lines are parallel, *corresponding* angles are **equal**. The given left\u2011hand interior angle is **40\u00b0**, so the angle in the same position on the right side must also be **40\u00b0**. | **A \u2013 40\u00b0** | **Correct**! | You applied the \u201ccorresponding = equal\u201d rule correctly. |\n| **b. Same\u2011side interior angle** | *Same\u2011side interior* angles are **supplementary**: they add to **180\u00b0**.  <br>180\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202f40\u00b0\u202f=\u202f**140\u00b0**. | **A \u2013 40\u00b0** | **Incorrect** | You gave the same measure as the original angle, but the two interior angles on the same side must sum to 180\u00b0, so the right\u2011hand one is 140\u00b0, not 40\u00b0. |\n| **c. Type of the angle from part\u202fb** | An angle of **140\u00b0** is larger than 90\u00b0 but smaller than 180\u00b0, which makes it an **obtuse** angle. | **A \u2013 Acute** | **Incorrect** | \u201cAcute\u201d describes angles **<\u202f90\u00b0**. Since the correct measure is 140\u00b0, the proper label is **Obtuse**. |\n\nSo you got the first part right, but the second and third parts need a little more practice with the *supplementary* idea and the angle\u2011type definitions.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 one step at a time\n\nWe\u2019ll break the problem into two tiny steps, each with a single\u2011choice answer.
