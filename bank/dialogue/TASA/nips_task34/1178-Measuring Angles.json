The other options describe angles that are either exactly 90\u00b0, between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, or exactly 180\u00b0, none of which match 68\u00b0.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick Check for Next Time  \n\n- If an angle measured **120\u00b0**, what type would it be?  \n- If an angle measured **90\u00b0**, what type would it be?  \n\nFeel free to write down your answers or sketch the angles on paper\u2014visualizing the protractor helps solidify the concept!",
