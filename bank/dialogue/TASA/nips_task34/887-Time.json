Your friend\u2019s concert starts **1\u202fhour and 75\u202fminutes** later.  \n> What time will the concert start? (Write the answer in 12\u2011hour format, e.g., \u201c2:05\u202fPM\u201d.)\n\n**How to approach it (same routine as before)**  \n\n1. **Add the whole\u2011hour part** (the \u201c1\u202fhour\u201d).  \n2. **Break the 75\u202fminutes** into hours\u202f+\u202fminutes.  \n3. **Add any extra hour(s)** that came from the minutes.  \n4. **Add the remaining minutes**.  \n5. **Adjust the AM/PM label** if you have passed noon.\n\nUse the table below to record each intermediate result.\n\n| Step | What to do | Your work |\n|------|------------|-----------|\n| a. Add the whole\u2011hour part | 11:50\u202fAM\u202f+\u202f**1\u202fhour** = ? | |\n| b. Convert the minutes | 75\u202fminutes = **?\u202fhour**\u202f+\u202f**?\u202fminute** | |\n| c. Add the extra hour(s) from the minutes | (result from a)\u202f+\u202f(extra hour(s) from b) = ? | |\n| d. Add the leftover minutes | (result from c)\u202f+\u202f(remaining minutes from b) = ? | |\n| e. Check AM/PM | Did you cross noon? Adjust label. | |\n\n**Hint if you get stuck**  \n- 75\u202fminutes \u00f7\u202f60\u202f=\u202f1\u202fremainder\u202f15, so 75\u202fminutes = **1\u202fhour\u202f15\u202fminutes**.  \n- Adding",
