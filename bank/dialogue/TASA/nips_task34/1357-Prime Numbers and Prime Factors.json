(Or maybe it\u2019s a number that can be divided by 1, itself, and sometimes\u202f2?)\u201d\n\n- **What\u2019s correct:** The first sentence is spot\u2011on. A prime number indeed has **exactly** two positive divisors:\u202f1 and the number itself.  \n- **What needs fixing:** The \u201csometimes\u202f2\u201d part is a misunderstanding. The number\u202f2 is itself a prime (its only divisors are\u202f1 and\u202f2). A prime is **never** required to be divisible by\u202f2 unless the prime *is*\u202f2. All other primes are odd, but that\u2019s a consequence, not part of the definition.\n\n**Part\u202fB \u2013 Identify primes**  \n\n| Number | 2 | 4 | 5 | 9 | 11 |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|----|\n| Your mark |   |   |   |   |    |\n\nYou didn\u2019t fill this in yet, so let\u2019s review together:\n\n| Number | 2 | 4 | 5 | 9 | 11 |\n|--------|---|---|---|---|----|\n| Prime?

You now have the correct classification.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 Building the idea of \u201conly two divisors\u201d\n\nBecause it\u2019s been a long time since you last worked with primes, we\u2019ll reinforce the definition with a very concrete activity.\n\n#### **Mini\u2011Lesson Recap**\nA **prime number** has **exactly two** positive divisors:\u202f1 and the number itself.  \nA **composite number** has **more than two** positive divisors (it can be \u201cbroken down\u201d into smaller factors).\n\n#### **Practice Question 1 \u2013 Spot the divisors**\n\nFor each of the numbers below, list **all** of its positive divisors. Then decide whether it is prime (P) or composite (C).\n\n| Number | 7 | 12 | 13 | 15 | 16 |\n|--------|---|----|----|----|----|\n| Divisors (write them) |  |    |    |    |    |\n| Prime / Composite |  |    |    |    |    |\n\n*Hints*  \n\n- Start with 1 and the number itself; then test the small numbers 2,\u202f3,\u202f4\u2026 up to \u221a(number).  \n- If you find **any** divisor other than 1 and the number, it\u2019s composite.\n\n#### **What we\u2019re looking for**\n\n- **If you list exactly two divisors (1 and the number)** \u2192 you should label it **P**.  \n- **If you list three or more divisors** \u2192 label it **C**.\n\nTake a moment, write the divisor lists, and then mark P or C. When you\u2019re ready, post your answer and we\u2019ll review it together!  \n\n---\n\n**Keep it simple and don\u2019t worry about speed** \u2013 the goal is to rebuild the \u201ctwo\u2011divisor\u201d idea in a concrete way.

Follow the same \u201cpartner\u2011pair\u201d routine we practiced with 16.\n\n| Step | What to do (write your answer in the blank) |\n|------|--------------------------------------------|\n| **b)** Test every integer from **2** up to \\(\\sqrt{12}\\) (\u2248\u202f3.5). For each number, ask: \u201cDoes it divide 12 without a remainder?\u201d If **yes**, write that divisor **and** its partner (the quotient\u202f\\(12 \u00f7 \\text{divisor}\\)). | ___ |\n\n**Tips for Step\u202fb**\n\n1. **Start with 2** \u2013 does 2 go into 12 evenly? (Hint: 12 \u00f7\u202f2 =\u202f6).  \n2. **Next try 3** \u2013 does 3 go into 12 evenly? (Hint: 12 \u00f7\u202f3 =\u202f4).  \n3. **Finally try 4** \u2013 you only need to test up to the integer part of \\(\\sqrt{12}\\), so 4 is *just* beyond the limit; you can stop after 3.\n\nWrite each successful divisor **and** its partner in the space below, e.g., \u201c2\u202f\u2194\u202f6\u201d.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, we\u2019ll move on to **Step\u202fc** (listing all the distinct divisors you\u2019ve collected).  \n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you find! \ud83c\udf1f",
