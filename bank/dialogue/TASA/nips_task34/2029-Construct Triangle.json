Using the ruler, draw a line segment \\(AB\\) that is exactly 6\u202fcm long.\n\n2. **Set the compass radius**  \n   Without changing the compass width, set the radius to **6\u202fcm** (the same length as \\(AB\\)).\n\n3. **Create the first arc**  \n   Place the compass point on \\(A\\) and draw an arc above (or below) the segment \\(AB\\).\n\n4. **Create the second arc**  \n   Without adjusting the compass, place the compass point on \\(B\\) and draw a second arc that intersects the first arc. Mark the intersection point as \\(C\\).\n\n5. **Complete the triangle**  \n   Use the straight\u2011edge to draw segments \\(AC\\) and \\(BC\\).\n\n6. **Check your work**  \n   Verify that \\(AB = AC = BC = 6\u202fcm\\). Because each side was created using the same compass radius, the three sides must be equal, giving you an equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### What to submit\n\n- **A written list** of the steps you performed (you can follow the scaffold above or write your own wording).  \n- **A brief justification** for each step (e.g., \u201cThe arcs intersect at a point that is 6\u202fcm from both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\); therefore the segments \\(AC\\) and \\(BC\\) are each 6\u202fcm, matching \\(AB\\).\u201d).\n\n*If you prefer, you may also attach a quick sketch showing points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) and the arcs you drew.*\n\n---\n\n#### Why this question is useful for you\n- It starts from the most basic construction (drawing a single segment) and builds directly on the definition of an equilateral triangle.  \n- By asking you to **explain** each step, it reinforces the underlying geometric reasons, helping the knowledge \u201cstick\u201d after a long period of inactivity.  \n\nGood luck! When you\u2019re ready, share your steps and reasoning, and we\u2019ll review them together.",

To finish the construction you need to:\n\n1. **Draw an arc with centre\u202f\\(A\\)** using the 6\u202fcm radius.  \n2. **Draw a second arc with centre\u202f\\(B\\)** using the same radius.  \n3. **Mark the intersection of the two arcs as\u202f\\(C\\).**  \n4. **Join\u202f\\(C\\) to\u202f\\(A\\) and\u202f\\(B\\).**  \n\n**Why those steps work:** any point on the first arc is exactly 6\u202fcm from\u202f\\(A\\); any point on the second arc is exactly 6\u202fcm from\u202f\\(B\\). The intersection point\u202f\\(C\\) is therefore 6\u202fcm from **both**\u202f\\(A\\) and\u202f\\(B\\).

The next steps reinforce the key geometric idea \u2013 *points on a circle are all the same distance from the centre* \u2013 which is the missing piece that will solidify the whole construction.\n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re ready paste your completed list (or a quick sketch) here.

So locating M is essential, but you still have to **construct** that midpoint and then **draw the line\u202fCM**.  Simply \u201cfinding\u201d it in your head isn\u2019t a valid geometric construction. |\n|\u202fMissing step | \u274c | You need a concrete compass\u2011and\u2011straight\u2011edge procedure to obtain the midpoint **M** of\u202fAB, and then a justification (or construction) that the line **CM** is perpendicular to\u202fAB.  The standard way is to construct the **perpendicular bisector** of\u202fAB; its intersection with\u202fAB is the midpoint **M**.  Because the triangle is isosceles, the segment\u202fCM\u202fwill automatically be the altitude (it is both a median and a perpendicular). |\n\n**What a complete solution looks like**\n\n1. **Draw the triangle** (as you already did).  \n2. **Construct the perpendicular bisector of\u202fAB**  \n   - With the compass set to any radius **greater than \u00bd\u202fAB**, draw an arc centered at **A** and another arc of the same radius centered at **B**.  \n   - The two arcs intersect the line\u202fAB\u202fin two points; call the intersection **P** (above\u202fAB) and **Q** (below\u202fAB).  \n   - Without changing the radius, draw arcs centered at **P** and **Q** that intersect each other; label the intersection **R**.  \n   - Draw the straight line **PR** (or **QR**).  This line is the **perpendicular bisector** of\u202fAB.  \n3. **Mark the midpoint\u202fM** \u2013 the point where the perpendicular bisector meets\u202fAB.  \n4. **Draw the altitude** \u2013 connect **C** to **M** with a straight line.",

I think I kind of get it now, but I\u2019m still a little fuzzy on the exact steps.\n\n1. **Draw the triangle** \u2013 I\u2019ll start the same way you showed, with AB\u202f=\u202f6\u202fcm and the two circles of radius\u202f8\u202fcm, pick a point C and join AC and BC.  \n\n2. **Find the midpoint of AB** \u2013 I guess I can just eyeball the middle of AB and call that M, right? I\u2019m not really sure how to \u201cconstruct\u201d it with the compass, but maybe I can just put the compass point on A, open it to half the length of AB (so about\u202f3\u202fcm) and swing an arc that hits the line at the middle?  \n\n3. **Perpendicular bisector** \u2013 I think I need to draw a line that\u2019s perpendicular to AB at M.

Draw the triangle** (AB\u202f=\u202f6\u202fcm, two 8\u2011cm circles, pick\u202fC, join\u202fAC and\u202fBC) | \u2705 | That part is solid \u2013 you can recreate the isosceles triangle. |\n| **2. \u201cEyeball\u201d the midpoint M of\u202fAB** | \u274c | In a geometric construction you can\u2019t rely on visual guessing. The midpoint must be obtained **with the compass and straight\u2011edge** so the result is exact and reproducible. |\n| **3. \u201cDraw a perpendicular at M\u201d by using a 6\u2011cm radius arc** | \u274c | A 6\u2011cm arc from A (or B) will not give you the perpendicular line. To get a line perpendicular to AB you first need the **perpendicular bisector** of AB (the set of points equidistant from A and B). The point where that bisector meets AB is the true midpoint M, and the bisector itself is already perpendicular to AB. |\n\nSo the missing pieces are:\n\n1. **Construct the midpoint of AB with a compass\u2011and\u2011straight\u2011edge procedure** (the classic perpendicular\u2011bisector construction).  \n2. **Recognise that the perpendicular bisector itself is the line you need** \u2013 once you have it, the segment from C to the midpoint M is automatically the altitude.\n\n---\n\n### A complete, step\u2011by\u2011step recipe (you can copy it onto a sheet of paper)\n\n1. **Draw the triangle** (as you already do).  \n2. **Construct the perpendicular bisector of AB**  \n   1. Place the compass point on **A**.  \n   2. Set the radius to **any length greater than \u00bd\u202fAB** (e.g., 4\u202fcm).  \n   3. Draw an arc **above** AB and another **below** AB.  \n   4. Without changing the radius, move the compass to **B** and draw a matching arc.  \n   5. The two arcs intersect AB\u2019s extensions in two points; call the upper intersection **P** and the lower one **Q**.  \n   6. Now place the compass on **P**, keep the same radius, and draw an arc that crosses the region between the two previous arcs.  \n   7. Without changing the radius, place the compass on **Q** and draw a second arc that meets the first one. Call their intersection **R**.  \n   8. Draw the straight line **PR** (or **QR**). This line is the **perpendicular bisector** of AB.  \n3. **Mark the midpoint M** \u2013 it is the point where the perpendicular bisector meets AB.  \n4. **Draw the altitude** \u2013 connect **C** to **M** with a straight line. Because the triangle is isosceles, **CM** is both a median and a perpendicular to AB, i.e., the altitude you wanted.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc49 Next practice (tailored to where you are now)\n\nYou\u2019ve just practiced the full triangle construction, but the *core* skill you\u2019re still solidifying is **constructing a midpoint (or perpendicular bisector) of a segment**.
