Anything that already says **minutes** stays the same.\n\n---\n\n## Your next practice \u2013 a smaller, focused set\n\nBelow are three activities.  \n1. **Write the unit** that is being used (seconds, minutes, or hours).  \n2. **Convert the whole duration to minutes** (show the calculation if you like).  \n\n| Activity | Duration (written in words) |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n| Science lab | **forty\u2011five minutes** |\n| Music class | **three\u2011quarter of an hour** |\n| Recess | **twenty minutes** |\n\n### What to do\n1. **Unit identification** \u2013 e.g., \u201cScience lab \u2013 minutes\u201d.  \n2. **Conversion** \u2013 e.g., \u201cMusic class \u2013 \u00be\u202fhour = 0.75\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f=\u202f45\u202fminutes\u201d.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re done, write the three answers in a list like this:\n\n```\nScience lab \u2013 minutes \u2013 45\u202fmin\nMusic class \u2013 hours \u2013 45\u202fmin\nRecess \u2013 minutes \u2013 20\u202fmin\n```\n\n---\n\n### Why this question matches where you are\n\n* **Same skills, fewer items** \u2013 you still practice naming the unit and converting, but only three items keep the cognitive load light.  \n* **Introduces a fractional hour** (\u201cthree\u2011quarter of an hour\u201d) \u2013 this expands the \u201chour \u2192 minutes\u201d rule you already know (multiply the fraction by 60).  \n* **Immediate feedback** \u2013 after you post your answers, I\u2019ll point out any slip\u2011ups and we\u2019ll move on to a short estimation challenge (just like part\u202fC of the original problem) once you\u2019re comfortable.\n\nGive it a try, and remember: it\u2019s okay to write \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d for any step; we\u2019ll sort it out together! \ud83d\ude80",
