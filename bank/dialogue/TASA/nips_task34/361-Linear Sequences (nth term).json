If the subtraction is off by even\u202f1, the whole formula that follows will be wrong, so a tiny \u201ccheck\u201d after you subtract can save a lot of re\u2011work later.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next \u201cjust\u2011right\u201d practice \u2013 a guided three\u2011step problem**\n\nWe\u2019ll use a sequence where the numbers are small and the subtraction is unmistakable.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2,\\; 6,\\; 10,\\; 14,\\; \\dots}\n\\]\n\n#### (a) Common difference  \n\nCopy the two numbers **exactly as they appear**, then subtract.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Step: } \\underline{\\,6\\,} \\;-\\; \\underline{\\,2\\,} = \\boxed{\\phantom{d}}\n\\]\n\n*Tip:* After you write \u201c6\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u201d, say the numbers out loud: \u201csix minus two \u2026 that\u2019s four.\u201d\u202fIf you\u2019re still unsure, count up from\u202f2\u202fto\u202f6\u202fon your fingers (3,\u202f4,\u202f5,\u202f6) \u2013 you\u2019ll see there are **four** steps.\n\n---\n\n#### (b) nth\u2011term formula (use \\(a_1 = 2\\))\n\nOnce you have the correct \\(d\\), plug it into the template  \n\n\\[\na_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n\\]\n\n\\[\na_n = \\boxed{\\phantom{______}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### (c) Find the 5th term (\\(n = 5\\))\n\nTake the formula from part\u202f(b) and replace \\(n\\) by\u202f5.\n\n\\[\na_{5}= \\boxed{\\phantom{______}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### How to move forward\n\n1. **Do the subtraction first** \u2013 write the two numbers, say them, then compute.  \n2. **Check your result** with a quick counting\u2011on\u2011fingers or mental \u201ccount up\u201d method.  \n3. **Insert that \\(d\\)** into the template; the algebra part is then just substitution.  \n4. **Evaluate for \\(n=5\\)** \u2013 again, a simple plug\u2011in.\n\nGive it a try and fill in the three boxes. If you get stuck at any step, just let me know which part feels unclear and we\u2019ll tackle it together. You\u2019ve already shown you can set up the subtraction; now we\u2019ll lock in the correct number and watch the whole sequence fall into place. \ud83c\udf1f",
