This time we\u2019ll order **from greatest (largest) to least (smallest)**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\tfrac{7}{2},\\; 3.2,\\; -1.8,\\; 0,\\; \\tfrac{5}{2},\\; -4,\\; 4,\\; -0.5}\n\\]\n\n**Which list is correct?**\n\nA) \\(4,\\; 3.2,\\; \\tfrac{5}{2},\\; 0,\\; -0.5,\\; -1.8,\\; -\\tfrac{7}{2},\\; -4\\)  \nB) \\(4,\\; 3.2,\\; \\tfrac{5}{2},\\; -0.5,\\; 0,\\; -1.8,\\; -\\tfrac{7}{2},\\; -4\\)  \nC) \\(4,\\; 3.2,\\; 0,\\; \\tfrac{5}{2},\\; -0.5,\\; -1.8,\\; -\\tfrac{7}{2},\\; -4\\)  \nD) \\(4,\\; \\tfrac{5}{2},\\; 3.2,\\; 0,\\; -0.5,\\; -1.8,\\; -\\tfrac{7}{2},\\; -4\\)\n\n*Choose the answer you think is right, then we\u2019ll walk through the reasoning together.*  \n\nGood luck\u2014you\u2019re ready for this next step! \ud83d\ude80",
