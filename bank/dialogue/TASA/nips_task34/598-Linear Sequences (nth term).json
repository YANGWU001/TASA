(There is no \u201coff\u2011by\u2011one\u2019\u2019 issue; the first term is \\(a_{1}=-4\\), the fifth term is indeed\u202f16.)\n\n2. **Checking\u202f\\(a_{19}\\)** \u2013 You also substituted \\(n=19\\) and got:  \n   \\[\n   a_{19}=5(19)-9=95-9=86,\n   \\]  \n   which matches the value we started with. So your verification is perfect.\n\n**Bottom line:** Both answers are correct! \ud83c\udf89 You\u2019ve shown that you can *go forward* (plug\u2011in a value of \\(n\\) to get a term) and *go backward* (solve for \\(n\\) when a term is given) with the same linear\u2011sequence formula.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013\u202fadd a tiny twist and keep the momentum\n\nWe\u2019ll do three short tasks that combine the forward\u2011 and backward\u2011direction skills you just demonstrated.\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Write the first five terms of the sequence  \n\nUsing \\(a_n = 5n-9\\), compute \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4,\\) and \\(a_5\\).  \n*Show each substitution and the arithmetic.*\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Find the 12th term  \n\n\\[\na_{12}= \\; ?\n\\]  \n*Substitute \\(n=12\\) into the formula and simplify.*\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Solve for the position when the term equals 124  \n\nSet the formula equal to 124 and solve for \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n5n - 9 = 124.\n\\]\n\n*Show every algebraic step (move the constant, then divide by 5) and give the final answer as \u201c\\(n =\\) \u2026\u201d.*\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Quick check (optional but helpful)  \n\nPlug the \\(n\\) you found in part\u202f3 back into the original formula to confirm you obtain 124.\n\n---\n\n### Why these steps help\n\n- **Part\u202f1** reinforces the \u201cplug\u2011in\u2019\u2019 direction for several consecutive values, cementing the pattern of the sequence.  \n- **Part\u202f2** gives another forward\u2011direction practice with a new index.  \n- **Part\u202f3** practices the reverse direction with a different target value, strengthening the solving\u2011for\u2011\\(n\\) skill.  \n- **Part\u202f4** builds a habit of verification\u2014always check your answer.\n\nGive it a try, write each step clearly, and post your answers. I\u2019m excited to see how you do! \ud83c\udf1f",
