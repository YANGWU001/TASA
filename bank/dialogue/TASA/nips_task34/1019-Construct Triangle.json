Mark its endpoints **X** and **Z**.\n\n2. **Construct the given angle at X**  \n   - Place the compass point on **X**.  \n   - With any convenient radius (larger than 5\u202fcm is fine), draw an arc that cuts the line through **X** on both sides of **XZ**; label the two intersection points **A** and **B**.  \n   - Without changing the compass width, move the compass to **A** and draw an arc.  \n   - Then move the compass to **B** and draw another arc that intersects the first one; call the intersection **C**.  \n   - Draw straight lines **XA** and **XB**.  \n   - Using a protractor (or the \u201cangle\u2011copy\u201d construction with a compass), copy a **60\u00b0** angle with vertex at **X**, opening toward the side opposite **XZ**. The ray you obtain is the line **XY**.\n\n3. **Mark the length of XY**  \n   - Set the compass to **7\u202fcm** (the length of XY).  \n   - Place the compass point on **X** and swing an arc that cuts the ray you just drew for **XY**.  \n   - Call the intersection point **Y**.  Now **XY = 7\u202fcm** and **\u2220YXZ = 60\u00b0** by construction.\n\n4. **Complete the triangle**  \n   - Draw the segment **YZ** to join the two free points **Y** and **Z**.  \n\nYou now have triangle **XYZ** that satisfies the three given conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Quick check (you can do this after you finish)\n\n| Quantity | Expected value | How to verify |\n|----------|----------------|---------------|\n| **XY**   | 7\u202fcm           | Measure with a ruler |\n| **XZ**   | 5\u202fcm           | Measure with a ruler |\n| **\u2220YXZ** | 60\u00b0            | Use a protractor or re\u2011measure the copied angle |\n| **Triangle** | All three conditions hold simultaneously | All three checks above are true |\n\n---\n\n### Why this question is suitable for you now  \n\n* You already know how to copy a given angle (your angle\u2011fact accuracy is ~74\u202f%).  \n* You have practiced measuring and laying off exact lengths with a compass.  \n* Putting the two skills together (SAS \u2013 **Side\u2011Angle\u2011Side**) is the next logical step before tackling the more ambiguous SSA cases.\n\nGive it a try, write down each construction step as you do it, and then run the quick check.
