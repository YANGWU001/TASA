The side that does **not** touch\u202fZ is\u202fXY, whose length is\u202f6\u202fcm. The compass should be set to **6\u202fcm** and an arc drawn above the base. |\n\nSo the only missing piece is the radius at\u202fZ (6\u202fcm). Once you draw that arc, the two arcs (the 11\u2011cm arc from\u202fY and the 6\u2011cm arc from\u202fZ) will intersect at the third vertex **X**. Then you simply join X to Y and X to Z.\n\n---\n\n**(2) Next practice \u2013 finish this construction and explain the rule**\n\n1. **Complete Step\u202f3** \u2013 write the full instruction for the arc at\u202fZ (include tool, radius, placement, \u201cabove the base\u201d direction).  \n2. **Final step** \u2013 state how you locate the third vertex X and what lines you draw to finish the triangle.  \n3. **Quick\u2011check (one sentence)** \u2013 answer: *Why does the radius at a base endpoint correspond to the side that does *not* include that endpoint?*\n\n*Write your three steps (base\u202f+\u202ftwo arcs\u202f+\u202fjoin the vertices) and the one\u2011sentence answer, and I\u2019ll give you immediate feedback.*  \n\nYou\u2019re almost there\u2014just add the 6\u202fcm arc and you\u2019ll have a complete, correct construction! \ud83c\udf1f",
