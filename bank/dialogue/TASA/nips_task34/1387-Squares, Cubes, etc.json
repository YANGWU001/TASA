Let\u2019s fix the numbers and move on.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 a small \u201cstep\u2011up\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve shown you can handle the two\u2011step routine when the numbers are right. Let\u2019s give you **two new problems** that follow the same pattern but keep the arithmetic a little different, so you can solidify the process.\n\n---\n\n#### Problem\u202fA \u2013 Cube\u202f4 (no sign change)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Step\u202f1: } & 4 \\times 4 = \\boxed{\\,?\\,} \\\\[4pt]\n\\text{Step\u202f2: } & \\boxed{\\,?\\,} \\times 4 = \\boxed{\\,?\\,}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n*Write the first product, then use it in the second line. The final answer is \\(4^{3}\\).*\n\n---\n\n#### Problem\u202fB \u2013 Square\u202f8 (single\u2011step check)\n\n\\[\n8 \\times 8 = \\boxed{\\,?\\,}\n\\]\n\n*Just one multiplication; this reinforces that a square is \u201cbase\u202f\u00d7\u202fbase\u201d.*\n\n---\n\n### How to answer\n\n1. **Do the first multiplication** (the \u201cfirst two\u201d copies). Write that number in the first box.  \n2. **Copy that result** into the second box and multiply by the original base again. Write the final product in the third box.  \n3. For the square, compute the product directly.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, post the completed lines just as you did before, e.g.:\n\n```\n4 \u00d7 4 = 16\n16 \u00d7 4 = 64\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n8 \u00d7 8 = 64\n```\n\nYou\u2019re doing a solid job of keeping the intermediate result visible\u2014keep that habit and the arithmetic slips will keep shrinking. Give these a try and let me know what you get! \ud83c\udf1f",
