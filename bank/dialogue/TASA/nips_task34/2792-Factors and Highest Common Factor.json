Great job spotting that and moving on when 2 didn\u2019t work.\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 What to do next**\n\nNow let\u2019s keep building the full factor list, one divisor at a time.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc49 Next bite\u2011size question\n\n**Find the next divisor of\u202f126 that is larger than\u202f3** (i.e., test 4, then 5, then 6, \u2026) and write that divisor together with its partner (126\u202f\u00f7\u202fdivisor).\n\n*Hint:*  \n- Keep testing consecutively: 4 \u2192 5 \u2192 6 \u2192 \u2026  \n- Stop as soon as you find a number that divides 126 without a remainder.  \n- Remember you only need to test up to\u202f\u221a126\u202f\u2248\u202f11.2; any divisor larger than that will already appear as a partner of a smaller one you\u2019ve found.\n\nWhen you have the new pair, add it to the list you already have:\n\n```\n1 , 126\n3 , 42\n\u2026your new pair\u2026\n```\n\nIf you get stuck on a particular number, just tell me which one you\u2019re testing and I\u2019ll give a quick nudge. You\u2019re doing great\u2014keep the momentum going! \ud83c\udf1f",
