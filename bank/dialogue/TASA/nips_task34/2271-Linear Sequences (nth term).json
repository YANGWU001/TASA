Write your answer in the space provided after each part.\n\n---\n\n1. **Find the common difference** \\(d\\).  \n   (The common difference is the amount you add each time to get from one term to the next.)\n\n   \\[\n   d = \\; \\boxed{\\phantom{xxxx}}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Write the formula for the \\(n\\)\u2011th term** \\(a_n\\) of the sequence.  \n   Recall the general form for an arithmetic sequence:  \n\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\n   \\]\n\n   where \\(a_1\\) is the first term.  \n   Using the values you found, fill in the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\boxed{\\phantom{xxxx}} \\;+\\; (n-1)\\bigl(\\boxed{\\phantom{xxxx}}\\bigr)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use your formula to find the 10th term** of the sequence.  \n   Substitute \\(n = 10\\) into the expression you wrote above.\n\n   \\[\n   a_{10} = \\boxed{\\phantom{xxxx}}\n   \\]\n\n---\n\n*What this question checks:*  \n\n- Recognizing that the sequence is linear (the same amount is added each step).  \n- Identifying the common difference.  \n- Translating the pattern into the standard \\(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\\) form.  \n- Applying the formula to compute a specific term.\n\nFeel free to write out each step; the process is more important than just the final number.
