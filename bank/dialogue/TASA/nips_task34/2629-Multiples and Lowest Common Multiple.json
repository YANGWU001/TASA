It tells me you\u2019re feeling a little stuck with the three\u2011machine problem. The question asks you to find the first time all three cycles line up again (the LCM of 8,\u202f15,\u202f20) and to show **two** ways to get that answer. Since you haven\u2019t tried any of the steps yet, we\u2019ll break the task into smaller, manageable pieces.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fNext practice \u2013 a guided step\u2011by\u2011step question**\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the **prime\u2011factor** method first; it\u2019s the fastest way to be sure you haven\u2019t missed a factor.\n\n> **Step\u202fA \u2013 Prime\u2011factor each period**  \n> Write each number (8,\u202f15,\u202f20) as a product of prime numbers.\n\n> **Step\u202fB \u2013 Take the highest power of every prime that appears**  \n> For each distinct prime, keep the largest exponent you see among the three factorizations.\n\n> **Step\u202fC \u2013 Multiply those highest\u2011power primes together**  \n> The product is the LCM of 8,\u202f15,\u202f20.\n\n> **Your task**  \n> 1. List the prime factorizations of 8, 15, and 20.  \n> 2. Identify the highest power of each prime (2,\u202f3,\u202f5).  \n> 3. Compute the LCM from those powers and write the final number (the number of minutes after 9:00\u202fam when the machines sync again).  \n\n> **Optional stretch** \u2013 Once you have the LCM, you can answer the bonus:  \n> *How many multiples of that LCM fit between 0\u202fminutes and 180\u202fminutes (the three\u2011hour window from 9:00\u202fam to 12:00\u202fpm)?*  \n\n**Hints**\n\n- 8 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 = 2\u00b3  \n- 15 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 (both to the first power)  \n- 20 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 2\u00b2\u00b75  \n\nTake the largest exponent for each prime (2\u00b3, 3\u00b9, 5\u00b9) and multiply them.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what you get for each step. If you get stuck at any point, just tell me which step is confusing and I\u2019ll walk you through it. You\u2019ve already mastered listing multiples, so this factor\u2011shortcut will become a powerful tool for any LCM problem!",
