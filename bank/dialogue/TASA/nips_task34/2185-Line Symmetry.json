In a regular isosceles triangle the two legs are equal, but the base is a different length, so that second line would not line up the two halves when folded.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is **B**, not C.**  \n\nYou were on the right track by identifying the vertical line; the extra line is the only part that needs adjustment.

Visualize (or sketch) the rectangle.  \n2. Imagine folding it along each possible line and see whether the two halves line up perfectly.  \n3. Choose the letter (A, B, C, or D) that best describes the rectangle\u2019s symmetry.\n\n*Write the letter you choose, and if you like, add a short note about why that line(s) works (or doesn\u2019t work).*\n\n---\n\n**You\u2019re doing a solid job of thinking through each shape\u2014keep using that \u201cfold\u2011and\u2011match\u201d mental picture, and the symmetry rules will become second nature.** \ud83d\udc4d\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, send me your answer!",
