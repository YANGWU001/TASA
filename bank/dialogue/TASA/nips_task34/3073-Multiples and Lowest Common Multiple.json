Great job! \ud83c\udf89\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next step \u2013\u202fnew LCM problem (using the prime\u2011factor method)**  \n\nWe\u2019ll practice the same skill with a different set of numbers:\n\n> **Workshops meet every 8\u202fminutes, 12\u202fminutes, and 18\u202fminutes.**  \n\nYour task is to find the *least common multiple* (LCM) of 8,\u202f12,\u202fand\u202f18.\n\n### What to do (in three short steps)\n\n| Step | What to write | Why it helps |\n|------|---------------|--------------|\n| **A** | **Factor each number into primes.** <br> e.g., \u201c8 = \u2026\u201d | Shows the building blocks we need to combine. |\n| **B** | **Identify the highest power of every prime that appears.** <br> List the primes you saw and write the biggest exponent for each. | The LCM must contain each prime at least as many times as it appears in any one factor. |\n| **C** | **Multiply those highest\u2011power primes together** to get the LCM. <br> Then write a sentence like \u201cAll three workshops will line up again after ___ minutes.\u201d | Gives the final answer and a real\u2011world interpretation. |\n\n### A gentle hint for each step\n\n1. **Prime factors**  \n   - 8 = \\(2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 2^3\\)  \n   - 12 = \\(2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 2^2\u00b73\\)  \n   - 18 = \\(2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 2\u00b73^2\\)\n\n2. **Highest powers**  \n   - For prime **2** the biggest exponent is **3** (from 8).  \n   - For prime **3** the biggest exponent is **2** (from 18).\n\n3. **LCM**  \n   - Multiply the highest powers: \\(2^3\u00b73^2 = 8\u00b79 = 72\\).\n\nNow write your sentence, e.g.:\n\n> \u201cAll three workshops will line up again after **72\u202fminutes**.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**What to post**\n\n- The three factorizations (Step\u202fA).  \n- The list of highest\u2011power primes (Step\u202fB).  \n- The product you get (Step\u202fC) and your sentence.\n\nIf any part feels shaky, just write what you think and I\u2019ll give you a quick nudge. You\u2019ve already shown you can spot the LCM by scanning a table; now we\u2019ll reinforce the *prime\u2011factor* shortcut so it becomes automatic. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nGive it a try\u2014post your work whenever you\u2019re ready!",
