      "content": "**What you did \u2013 quick check**\n\n1. **Whole\u2011product** \u2013 You wrote \\((-4x+7)(3x+2)\\).  \n   The problem\u2019s width is **\\(3x-2\\)**, not \\(3x+2\\). So the correct product is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{(-4x+7)(3x-2)} .\n   \\]\n\n2. **FOIL terms** \u2013 With the right product the four pieces are  \n\n   | step | calculation | result |\n   |------|-------------|--------|\n   | **First** | \\((-4x)(3x)\\) | \\(-12x^{2}\\) |\n   | **Outer** | \\((-4x)(-2)\\) | \\(+8x\\) |\n   | **Inner** | \\(7(3x)\\) | \\(+21x\\) |\n   | **Last**  | \\(7(-2)\\) | \\(-14\\) |\n\n   You correctly noticed that the outer term should involve \u201c\u20112\u201d, which flips its sign to **positive**.\n\n3. **Combine like terms** \u2013 The two \\(x\\)-terms add to \\(8x+21x = 29x\\).  \n   The fully\u2011simplified area expression is  \n\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{-12x^{2}+29x-14}.\n   \\]\n\nSo the only error was the sign on the second binomial; everything else follows once that is fixed. Great job catching the sign issue in the \u201cOuter\u201d term!\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 same skill, new numbers\n\nWe\u2019ll repeat the three\u2011step routine, but with different binomials so the idea sticks.\n\n### Problem\n\nMultiply the binomials \\((5y-4)(-2y+3)\\) and then evaluate the result at \\(y = 1\\).\n\n#### Step\u202f1 \u2013 Write the whole product  \nFill in the blank:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\; \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\;}\n\\]\n\n*(Hint: just place the two parentheses next to each other with a multiplication sign.)*\n\n#### Step\u202f2 \u2013 FOIL the product  \nList the four terms you obtain.\n\n- **First:** \\_\\_\\_\\_  \n- **Outer:** \\_\\_\\_\\_  \n- **Inner:** \\_\\_\\_\\_  \n- **Last:**  \\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#### Step\u202f3 \u2013 Combine like terms  \nWrite the simplified quadratic expression:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\; \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ \\;}\n\\]\n\n#### Step\u202f4 \u2013 Evaluate at \\(y = 1\\)  \nShow each tiny calculation (e.g., \\(y^{2}=1\\), then multiply each term) and give the final numeric area:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\; \\text{Area when } y=1 = \\_\\_\\_\\_ \\;}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### How to approach it\n\n1. **Whole product:** remember the signs exactly as they appear in each binomial.  \n2. **FOIL:**  \n   - *First* = first term of the first binomial \u00d7 first term of the second.  \n   - *Outer* = first term of the first \u00d7 last term of the second.  \n   - *Inner* = last term of the first \u00d7 first term of the second.  \n   - *Last* = last term of the first \u00d7 last term of the second.  \n3. **Combine:** add the two \\(y\\)-terms; the \\(y^{2}\\) and constant terms stay as they are.  \n4. **Evaluate:** substitute \\(y=1\\) and compute step\u2011by\u2011step.\n\nGive it a try\u2014write just **Step\u202f1** first. If you get stuck, let me know exactly which part is confusing and I\u2019ll give a quick nudge. You\u2019ve already shown you can handle the FOIL pattern; now it\u2019s just a matter of copying the signs correctly. \ud83c\udf1f",
