Even if 48 were a multiple of both, it would be larger than 36, so it could not be the *least* common multiple.\n\nGreat job spotting the overlap; you just need to stop at the **first** one you see. \ud83d\udc4d\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 a tiny step forward**\n\nNow let\u2019s reinforce the \u201cstop at the first overlap\u201d rule with a new pair where the first common multiple isn\u2019t the very first number you write down.\n\n> **Find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of 10 and\u202f12.**\n\n**Helpful steps (pick whichever feels easiest):**\n\n1. **List a few multiples** of each number.  \n   - Multiples of\u202f10:\u202f10,\u202f20,\u202f30,\u202f40,\u202f50,\u202f60,\u202f\u2026  \n   - Multiples of\u202f12:\u202f12,\u202f24,\u202f36,\u202f48,\u202f60,\u202f\u2026  \n\n2. **Look for the smallest number that appears in *both* lists.**  \n\n   *(If you want a backup, use the prime\u2011factor method:  \n   10\u202f=\u202f2\u00b75,\u200312\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u00b73 \u2192 LCM\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u00b73\u00b75\u202f=\u202f60.)*\n\nWrite down the first number you see in **both** lists and tell me which one you think is the LCM. Remember: the moment you spot the first common entry, that\u2019s the answer! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nYou\u2019re doing really well\u2014keep an eye on that first overlap and you\u2019ll nail it. I\u2019m looking forward to your answer!",
