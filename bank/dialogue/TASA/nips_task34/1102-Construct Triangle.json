Using only these tools, you need to **construct a triangle whose side lengths are 4\u202fcm, 5\u202fcm, and 6\u202fcm**.  \n\n---\n\n### What you must do  \n\n1. **List the three construction steps** (in the correct order) that will give you the required triangle.  \n2. **Indicate which point you start drawing first** (the first vertex you create).  \n\nWrite your answer as a short, numbered list, e.g.:\n\n1. \u2026  \n2. \u2026  \n3. \u2026\n\n---\n\n### Hints (you can use them if you get stuck)\n\n* The first step is always to draw a line segment that will become one side of the triangle.  \n* After you have a line segment, you\u2019ll need to use the compass to \u201cswing\u201d arcs from the endpoints of that segment.  \n* The intersection of those arcs gives you the third vertex.  \n\n---\n\n### Example of a correct answer format (for a different set of side lengths)\n\n1. Draw a line segment\u202fAB\u202f=\u202f3\u202fcm.  \n2. With the compass set to 4\u202fcm, draw an arc centered at\u202fA.  \n3. With the compass set to 5\u202fcm, draw an arc centered at\u202fB; label the intersection of the two arcs\u202fC.  \n\nNow\u202f\u0394ABC\u202fhas the desired side lengths.\n\n---\n\n**Your task:** Fill in the three steps (and the starting point) that will let you construct the triangle with sides **4\u202fcm, 5\u202fcm, and 6\u202fcm**.",

The shortest side works, but the reasoning \u201ceasier to swing the other two lengths\u201d isn\u2019t quite the usual justification.
