That is indeed the **least common multiple (LCM)** of 8 and 12.  \n\nWhy it works: the LCM is the *smallest* positive integer that each original number divides into without a remainder. By writing out the multiples, you directly saw the first common one, so your answer is spot\u2011on.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice \u2013 A Slightly Bigger Challenge\n\n**Find the least common multiple of 9 and 15.**  \n\n*Instructions*  \n1. **Use the prime\u2011factorization method** (instead of listing multiples) to practice a different technique.  \n2. Show each step:  \n   - Write the prime factorization of each number.  \n   - For each prime that appears, record the **highest exponent** found in either factorization.  \n   - Multiply those primes together to get the LCM.  \n3. After you have the LCM, **verify** it by checking that both 9 and 15 divide evenly into your answer.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick reminder of the prime\u2011factorization method  \n\n| Number | Prime factorization |\n|--------|---------------------|\n| 9      | \\(3^2\\)             |\n| 15     | \\(3^1 \\times 5^1\\)  |\n\n- Take each prime that appears (here, 3 and 5).  \n- Use the **larger exponent** for each prime (for 3 it\u2019s \\(2\\); for 5 it\u2019s \\(1\\)).  \n- Multiply: \\(3^2 \\times 5^1 = 9 \\times 5 = 45\\).  \n\nSo you should end up with **45** as the LCM, but please work it out yourself and show the steps.\n\n---\n\n**Give it a try and let me know your answer and how you arrived at it!** If you get stuck, just ask for a hint\u2014I'm here to help.",
