Show each step (break the interval into hours and minutes, then combine).\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step scaffold\n\n1. **Write the two times in a table**\n\n|   | Hours | Minutes |\n|---|-------|---------|\n| Start | 6 | 20 |\n| End   | 9 | 05 |\n\n2. **Subtract the minutes first**  \n   - 05\u202fminutes \u2013 20\u202fminutes \u2192 we can\u2019t subtract a larger number from a smaller one, so we **borrow 1 hour** (which is 60 minutes) from the \u201chours\u201d column.\n\n   After borrowing:\n   - Hours column: 9\u202f\u2192\u202f8 (we gave one hour to the minutes)\n   - Minutes column: 05\u202f+\u202f60\u202f=\u202f65 minutes\n\n   Now subtract: 65\u202fminutes \u2013 20\u202fminutes = **45\u202fminutes**.\n\n3. **Subtract the hours** (after the borrowing)  \n   - 8\u202fhours \u2013 6\u202fhours = **2\u202fhours**.\n\n4. **Combine the results**  \n   - **2\u202fhours\u202f45\u202fminutes**.\n\nSo the movie lasts **2\u202fhours\u202f45\u202fminutes**.\n\n---\n\n### Why this works\n- **Borrowing** is the same trick you used when you turned \u201c90\u202fminutes = 1\u202fhour\u202f30\u202fminutes\u201d in the school\u2011day problem.  \n- By handling minutes first, you avoid negative minutes and keep the arithmetic straightforward.\n\n---\n\n## Your turn \u2013 a similar but slightly different problem\n\n> **Practice Question:** A train departs at **4\u202f:\u202f55\u202fPM** and arrives at **7\u202f:\u202f22\u202fPM**.  \n> How long is the train ride? Show each step (use the borrowing method if needed).\n\n### How to approach it\n1. List the start and end times in a table.  \n2. Subtract the minutes (borrow an hour if the end\u2011minutes are smaller).  \n3. Subtract the hours (remember the hour you borrowed).  \n4. Put the two pieces together.\n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re ready, send me your work (or let me know where you get stuck). You\u2019ve already shown you can handle the \u201cborrow\u201d idea, so you\u2019re well\u2011equipped to finish this one. \ud83c\udf1f",

That means we can\u2019t tell whether the formula, the algebra, or the unit\u2011conversion was right.  \n*Why it\u2019s marked incorrect:* the answer was **blank**, so none of the required pieces were shown. To get the credit you need to write each step explicitly (the formula, the isolated\u2011\\(t\\) expression, the substitution, the calculation in hours, and the conversion to minutes).  \n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next practice \u2013 \u201cfill\u2011in\u2011the\u2011blank\u201d style\n\nLet\u2019s keep the same scaffold, but this time I\u2019ll give you the first two rows and leave the rest for you to complete. This will let you focus on the arithmetic and the unit conversion while still practising the whole process.\n\n### Problem  \nA **hiker** walks at a constant speed of **4\u202fkm\u202f\u2044\u202fh**.  \nHow many **minutes** does it take to travel **3\u202fkm**?\n\n### Your worksheet\n\n| Step | What you should write (fill\u2011in) |\n|------|---------------------------------|\n| a. Write the formula | \\(d = s \\times t\\) |\n| b. Isolate \\(t\\) | \\(t = \\dfrac{d}{s}\\) |\n| c. Substitute the numbers | \\(t = \\dfrac{3\\ \\text{km}}{4\\ \\text{km/h}}\\) |\n| d. Compute the time in **hours** | **_____** (simplify the fraction or turn it into a decimal) |\n| e. Convert hours \u2192 minutes | **_____** (multiply the hour\u2011value by 60) |\n\n#### What to send back\n1. The completed rows\u202fd and\u202fe (you can write the whole table again if you wish).  \n2. The final answer in minutes (exact value or rounded to the nearest whole minute).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Quick hint (if you get stuck)\n\n- **Step\u202fd:** \\(\\dfrac{3}{4}\\)\u202fh = 0.75\u202fh.  \n- **Step\u202fe:** \\(0.75\\ \\text{h} \\times 60\\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{h}} = 45\\ \\text{min}\\).\n\nTry doing it on your own first; if any part feels fuzzy, let me know exactly which step and I\u2019ll give a focused cue. You\u2019ve already mastered the formula\u2011setup, so you\u2019re well on your way to locking in the conversion skill! \ud83c\udf1f",
