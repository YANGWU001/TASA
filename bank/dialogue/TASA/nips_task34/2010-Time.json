Added the 85\u202fminutes to the minutes\u2011hand, getting **115\u202fminutes**.  \n3. Recognised that 115\u202fminutes is more than 60, so you needed to turn some of those minutes into whole hours.\n\nThe mistake was in the conversion step:\n\n- **115\u202fminutes \u00f7\u202f60 = 1\u202fhour\u202fand\u202f55\u202fminutes** is *almost* right, but the \u201c55\u202fminutes\u201d part is the **remainder after removing the full hour**.  \n- You already had **30\u202fminutes** in the original time. When you turn **60\u202fminutes** of the 115\u202fminutes into an extra hour, you are left with **115\u202f\u2013\u202f60\u202f=\u202f55\u202fminutes** *to add to the original 30\u202fminutes*.  \n\nSo the correct addition is:\n\n```\nStart:   2 : 30\nAdd 85 min \u2192 30 + 85 = 115 minutes\n115 minutes = 1 hour + 55 minutes\nAdd the 1 hour to the hour\u2011hand: 2 + 1 = 3\nAdd the remaining 55 minutes to the minutes\u2011hand: 0 + 55 = 55\nResult: 3 : 55 PM\n```\n\nTherefore the next bell rings at **3\u202f:\u202f55\u202fPM**, not 4\u202f:\u202f15\u202fPM.  \nYou were very close! The only thing to watch is that when you \u201ccarry over\u201d the 60 minutes, you **remove** them from the total minutes before you add the remainder to the original minutes\u2011hand.\n\n---\n\n### Next practice \u2013 keep building that skill!\n\n**Problem**\n\nA school lunch break starts at **1\u202f:\u202f45\u202fPM**. The lunch period lasts **130\u202fminutes**.\n\n1. What time does lunch end?  \n2. Show your work step\u2011by\u2011step (add the minutes, convert any excess minutes into hours, then adjust the hour\u2011hand).\n\n*Tip:*  \n- First add the 130\u202fminutes to the minutes\u2011hand (45\u202f+\u202f130).  \n- If the sum is 60 or more, divide by 60 to find how many whole hours to carry over, and keep the remainder as the new minutes.  \n- Add the carried\u2011over hours to the original hour\u2011hand.\n\nGive it a try, and remember you\u2019re already comfortable with the \u201ccarry\u2011over\u201d idea\u2014you just need to apply it carefully.

Once you have 125\u202fminutes you can convert the excess into whole hours + remaining minutes and then carry those hours onto the hour\u2011hand (watch for the midnight wrap\u2011around). |\n\nYou\u2019re on the right track \u2013 you just need to finish the arithmetic and then follow the same four\u2011step routine we used for the bus problem.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201cjust\u2011right\u201d challenge  \n\nNow let\u2019s reinforce the whole process (add minutes, turn excess into hours\u202f+\u202fremainder, carry the hour(s) onto the hour\u2011hand, and wrap past midnight).  \nWe\u2019ll also add a tiny twist: after you find the arrival time, you\u2019ll **subtract** a few minutes (think of it as \u201csetting the alarm earlier\u201d).\n\n> **Problem**  \n> A late\u2011night train departs at **10\u202f:\u202f45\u202fPM** and the journey lasts **80\u202fminutes**.  \n> 1\ufe0f\u20e3 What time does the train arrive?
