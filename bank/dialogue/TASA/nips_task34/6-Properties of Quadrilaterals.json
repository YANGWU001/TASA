That\u2019s completely fine \u2013 the problem is a little tricky because it asks you to decide which statement must be true **for every** quadrilateral that meets the given measurements and angle conditions.  \n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning you\u2019ll need (you can use it as a hint if you want to try the problem again):\n\n| Given data | What it tells us |\n|------------|------------------|\n| \\(AB = CD = 8\\)\u202fcm and \\(BC = DA = 5\\)\u202fcm | Opposite sides are equal in length. |\n| \\(\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle CDA = 90^\\circ\\) | Two opposite interior angles are right angles. |\n\nWhen a quadrilateral has **both pairs of opposite sides equal**, it is a **parallelogram** (this is one of the defining properties of a parallelogram).  \nA parallelogram does **not** have to be a rectangle; it becomes a rectangle only when **all** interior angles are right angles. Here we know only two opposite angles are right angles, so the shape could be a rectangle **or** could be a non\u2011rectangular parallelogram (imagine \u201csliding\u201d the top side a little to the left while keeping the side lengths the same).  \n\nTherefore the statement that is **always true** is:\n\n**C)\u202f\\(ABCD\\) is a parallelogram but not necessarily a rectangle.**\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 building on what you just reviewed\n\nBecause you\u2019re already comfortable with the idea that \u201cequal opposite sides \u21d2 parallelogram,\u201d let\u2019s reinforce that concept and add a little twist with angle information.\n\n### Practice Question\n\nIn quadrilateral \\(WXYZ\\) the following are true:\n\n* \\(WX = 7\\)\u202fcm, \\(YZ = 7\\)\u202fcm (the two opposite sides are equal)  \n* \\(\\angle WXY = 110^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle XYZ = 70^\\circ\\)\n\nWhich of the following **must** be true about \\(WXYZ\\)?\n\nA) It is a parallelogram.  \nB) It is a kite.  \nC) It is a convex quadrilateral but not a parallelogram.  \nD) It is a rhombus.\n\n*(Explain briefly why the correct choice follows from the given information.)*\n\n---\n\n### Why this question fits your current level  \n\n* You\u2019ve shown moderate mastery of quadrilateral properties, so the question revisits a core rule (equal opposite sides \u2192 parallelogram) while also asking you to consider how the angle measures influence the classification.  \n* The side\u2011length condition is enough to force a parallelogram, regardless of the angles, so the correct answer will be **A**.  \n* Working through the reasoning will strengthen the connection between side\u2011length criteria and the definition of a parallelogram, which is exactly the gap highlighted by your recent attempts.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know what answer you choose and why!

Here \\(110^\\circ + 70^\\circ = 180^\\circ\\), so the angle condition is **consistent** with a parallelogram, not contradictory. |\n\nBecause the side\u2011length condition alone already forces the figure to be a parallelogram, the statement \u201cnot a parallelogram\u201d cannot be true for **every** quadrilateral that satisfies the data.  \n\n**The correct answer is A)\u202fIt is a parallelogram.**  \n(Options B, C, and D are not guaranteed \u2013 a kite, a rhombus, or a non\u2011parallelogram shape could also satisfy the given numbers, but they are not forced.)\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3  Next practice \u2013 building on what you just reviewed  \n\nNow that you see how **both** side\u2011length criteria and angle relationships work together, let\u2019s stretch the idea a little further.  \n\n#### Practice Question  \n\nIn quadrilateral \\(PQRS\\) the following are true:\n\n* \\(PQ = 6\\)\u202fcm, \\(RS = 6\\)\u202fcm (one pair of opposite sides equal)  \n* \\(QR = 9\\)\u202fcm, \\(SP = 9\\)\u202fcm (the other pair of opposite sides equal)  \n* \\(\\angle QRS = 120^\\circ\\)\n\nWhich of the following **must** be true about \\(PQRS\\)?\n\nA) \\(PQRS\\) is a parallelogram.  \nB) \\(PQRS\\) is a rectangle.  \nC) \\(PQRS\\) is a rhombus.  \nD) \\(PQRS\\) is a kite but not a parallelogram.\n\n*(Explain briefly why the correct choice follows from the given information.)*\n\n---\n\n### Why this question matches your current level  \n\n* **Side\u2011length focus:** You have just practiced the \u201cboth pairs of opposite sides equal \u21d2 parallelogram\u201d rule.

Recognising which information is essential and which is incidental is a key skill at your stage.  \n* **Answer reasoning:** The correct answer is **A**. Because both opposite sides are equal, the quadrilateral must be a parallelogram regardless of the angle. It need **not** be a rectangle (all angles 90\u00b0) nor a rhombus (all sides",
