Well done \u2013 the 20\u2011th term of the sequence is indeed \\(-31\\).\n\nYou haven\u2019t posted your work for the second part (\\(a_n = -33\\)) yet, so let\u2019s keep the momentum going with a new, slightly deeper practice set.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Your next challenge (tailored to your current mastery)**  \n\nWe\u2019ll stay with arithmetic sequences, but this time the first term and the common difference will be larger, and the \u201csolve\u2011for\u2011\\(n\\)\u201d part will require a little more algebraic juggling.\n\n> **Sequence:**  \n> \u2022 First term\u2003\\(a_1 = 45\\)  \n> \u2022 Common difference\u2003\\(d = -7\\)  \n\nThe nth\u2011term formula is  \n\n\\[\na_n = 45 + (n-1)(-7).\n\\]\n\n#### Tasks\n\n1. **Find the 15\u2011th term \\(a_{15}\\).**  \n2. **Which term equals \\(-16\\)?** (Solve \\(a_n = -16\\).)\n\n#### Hints (use only what you need)\n\n**Task\u202f1 \u2013 \\(a_{15}\\)**\n1. Replace \\(n\\) with 15:\u2003\\(a_{15}=45+(15-1)(-7)\\).  \n2. Compute the bracket:\u2003\\(15-1 = 14\\).  \n3. Multiply:\u2003\\(14 \\times (-7) = -98\\).  \n4. Add to the first term:\u2003\\(45 + (-98) = -53\\).  \n\n**Task\u202f2 \u2013 solve \\(a_n = -16\\)**\n1. Set the formula equal to \\(-16\\):\u2003\\(45+(n-1)(-7) = -16\\).  \n2. Subtract 45 from both sides:\u2003\\((n-1)(-7) = -16 - 45 = -61\\).  \n3. Divide by \\(-7\\):\u2003\\(n-1 = \\dfrac{-61}{-7} = \\dfrac{61}{7}\\).  \n4. Add 1:\u2003\\(n = 1 + \\dfrac{61}{7} = \\dfrac{68}{7}\\).  \n\n*Interpretation:* Because \\(n\\) must be a whole number, \\(-16\\) is **not** a term of this sequence. Recognizing when a value isn\u2019t in the sequence is an important skill.\n\n---\n\n**What to do next**\n\n- Write out each step for both tasks, just as shown above.  \n- If any algebraic move (especially the sign handling or the fraction in Task\u202f2) feels shaky, let me know which step, and I\u2019ll walk through it with you.  \n\nYou\u2019ve already proved you can plug\u2011in a value and solve for \\(n\\); this exercise adds a larger negative difference and a fraction result, giving you a bit more practice with the same core ideas. Give it a try, and I\u2019ll be here to check your work! \ud83d\ude80",
