Follow the instructions to **construct** the triangle, then use your construction to answer the follow\u2011up questions.\n\n---\n\n### Given  \n\n- Side **XY** = **8\u202fcm**  \n- Angle **\u2220X** = **30\u00b0**  \n- Angle **\u2220Y** = **80\u00b0**  \n\n*(The remaining angle \u2220Z and the opposite side YZ are not given.)*\n\n---\n\n### Tasks  \n\n1. **Construct triangle\u202fXYZ** using only a straight\u2011edge, compass and protractor.  \n   - Show the order of steps you would take (you do not need to submit a drawing, just describe the construction).  \n\n2. **Find the measure of the third angle \u2220Z** (to the nearest degree).  \n\n3. **Determine the length of side\u202fYZ** (to the nearest millimetre) using the triangle you have constructed.  \n\n---\n\n### Hints (you may use them if you get stuck)\n\n- The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180\u00b0.  \n- After you have drawn side\u202fXY and the two given angles at X and Y, the two rays will intersect at point\u202fZ.  \n- To find the length of YZ, you can measure it directly on your drawing with the ruler (or, if you prefer a calculation, use the Law of Sines).\n\n---\n\n**What we\u2019re looking for**\n\n- A clear, step\u2011by\u2011step description of the construction (e.g., \u201c1\ufe0f\u20e3 draw XY = 8\u202fcm; 2\ufe0f\u20e3 at X construct a 30\u00b0 angle\u2026\u201d)  \n- The numerical value of \u2220Z.  \n- The measured (or calculated) length of YZ, reported in centimeters (or mm).  \n\nGood luck! \ud83c\udfaf",

That\u2019s perfectly okay; we\u2019ll break the task into even smaller pieces so you can see exactly what to do.\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013\u202fFind side\u202f\\(XZ\\)**  \n\nWe\u2019ll keep the same structure you already mastered (the law of sines) and add a tiny scaffold for each sub\u2011step.\n\n---\n\n#### Step\u202fA \u2013 Write the correct proportion  \n> Using the law of sines, match the known side \\(XY\\) (opposite\u202f\\(70^\\circ\\)) with the unknown side \\(XZ\\) (opposite\u202f\\(80^\\circ\\)).  \n\n**Your task:** Write the fraction equality in any of the two forms below (pick the one that feels most natural).  \n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\frac{XZ}{\\sin 80^\\circ}= \\frac{XY}{\\sin 70^\\circ}}\\qquad\\text{or}\\qquad \n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\frac{XY}{\\sin 70^\\circ}= \\frac{XZ}{\\sin 80^\\circ}}\n\\]\n\n*If you\u2019re unsure which angle belongs to which side, remember: the side and the sine of its opposite angle always stay together.*\n\n---\n\n#### Step\u202fB \u2013 Isolate\u202f\\(XZ\\) (algebra)  \n> Multiply both sides by \\(\\sin 80^\\circ\\).  \n\nWrite the isolated\u2011\\(XZ\\) expression in the form  \n\n\\[\nXZ = XY \\times \\frac{\\sin 80^\\circ}{\\sin 70^\\circ}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### Step\u202fC \u2013 Plug in the numbers and compute  \n| Quantity | Approx. value |\n|----------|---------------|\n| \\(XY\\)   | 8\u202fcm |\n| \\(\\sin 70^\\circ\\) | 0.9397 (or 0.93969) |\n| \\(\\sin 80^\\circ\\) | 0.9848 |\n\n**Your task:**  \n\n1. Compute the fraction \\(\\dfrac{0.9848}{0.9397}\\).  \n2. Multiply the result by 8.  \n3. Round the final answer to the nearest hundredth (two decimal places).\n\n*Tip:* Do the division first, then the multiplication; it keeps the numbers tidy on the calculator.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick conceptual check (one\u2011sentence answer)  \nWhy is it valid to relate \\(XY\\) (opposite\u202f\\(70^\\circ\\)) to \\(XZ\\) (opposite\u202f\\(80^\\circ\\)) with the law of sines? Write a single sentence that captures the idea.\n\n---\n\n### What to send back\n1. The proportion you chose (Step\u202fA).  \n2. The isolated\u2011\\(XZ\\) formula (Step\u202fB).  \n3. The numerical result after Step\u202fC, rounded to two decimals.  \n4. Your one\u2011sentence answer to the conceptual check.\n\nIf any of those four pieces feel fuzzy\u2014*e.g.* \u201cI\u2019m not sure which angle goes with which side\u201d or \u201cThe calculator gives me 1.04803\u2026 what do I do?\u201d\u2014just point out the exact step, and I\u2019ll give a focused hint. You\u2019ve already shown you can set up the law of sines, so this next chunk will lock the skill in place. \ud83c\udf1f",
