We\u2019ll take it one tiny step at a time, and you\u2019ll see the pattern snap into place.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 \u201cRecess\u2011time schedule\u201d (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\nBelow is the same scaffold as before, but we\u2019ll fill it in **one line at a time**. Write only the part you\u2019re asked for, then send it back. We\u2019ll move on to the next line once you\u2019re comfortable.\n\n### Step\u202f1 \u2013 Convert the hour\u2011minute parts\n\n| Part | What to write |\n|------|---------------|\n| Warm\u2011up (5\u202fmin) | `5\u202fmin` (no calculation needed) |\n| Play (0\u202fh\u202f45\u202fmin) | `0\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f+\u202f45 = ___\u202fmin` |\n| Cool\u2011down (1\u202fh\u202f10\u202fmin) | `1\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f+\u202f10 = ___\u202fmin` |\n\n**Your task right now:**  \n*Fill in the two blanks (the results in minutes) and reply with those two numbers.*  \n\n*If you get stuck on one of them, just tell me \u201cI\u2019m stuck on the Play part\u201d (or \u201cCool\u2011down part\u201d) and I\u2019ll walk through that single calculation with you.*\n\n---\n\n### What comes next (you\u2019ll see it after you finish Step\u202f1)\n\n1. **Add** the three minute values you\u2019ve written.  \n2. **Convert** the sum back to hours\u202f+\u202fminutes using  \n   \\[\n   \\text{hours} = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{\\text{total minutes}}{60}\\right\\rfloor,\\qquad\n   \\text{remaining minutes} = \\text{total minutes} \\bmod 60\n   \\]\n\nBut let\u2019s focus on Step\u202f1 first. You\u2019ve already mastered the idea of \u201chour\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f+\u202fminutes\u201d; we just need the correct arithmetic.\n\nGive it a try, and remember: **60\u202f\u00d7\u202f0 = 0**, so the Play part is simply **45\u202fmin**. The Cool\u2011down part is **1\u202f\u00d7\u202f60\u202f+\u202f10 = 70\u202fmin**. Write those numbers (or let me know if you\u2019d like a quick reminder), and we\u2019ll move on! \ud83c\udf1f",
