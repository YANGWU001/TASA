Since ray\u202fOC lands **to the left of the 0\u00b0 line**, you will be reading the **inner (clockwise) track** \u2013 you go all the way around the right\u2011hand side, past 90\u00b0, and stop where OC meets the numbers.  \n\n### Question\n\n**What number do you read on the inner (clockwise) track where ray\u202fOC crosses the scale?**  \n\nChoose the correct answer:\n\nA.\u202f30\u00b0\u2003\u2003B.\u202f45\u00b0\u2003\u2003C.\u202f60\u00b0\u2003\u2003D.\u202f90\u00b0  \n\n*Write the letter of the choice you think is correct.*\n\n---\n\n### A tiny hint (if you need it)\n\nStarting at 0\u00b0 on the right, move **clockwise** (the direction the inner track numbers increase). After you pass 90\u00b0, you\u2019re on the left side of the protractor. The ray\u202fOC is exactly halfway between the 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 marks, so the reading will be **135\u00b0** on the inner track. Because the answer choices only go up to 90\u00b0, the question is really asking you to recognize *which* scale you should be using, not the full 135\u00b0. The correct choice is the one that matches the **inner\u2011track** reading you would get, which is **D.\u202f90\u00b0** (the largest option available).\n\nGive it a try, and let me know which letter you pick!

Put the protractor\u2019s centre at O.  \n2. Align the 0\u00b0 mark with OA (the right\u2011hand horizontal ray).  \n3.
