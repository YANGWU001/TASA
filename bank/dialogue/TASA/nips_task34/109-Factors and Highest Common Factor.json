Write down all the positive factors of **20**.  \n2. Write down all the positive factors of **30**.  \n3. Circle the numbers that appear in **both** lists \u2013 those are the common factors.  \n4. Identify the largest number among the common factors. That number is the **HCF of 20 and 30**.\n\n**Hints**\n\n- To find factors quickly, test each integer from 1 up to the number (e.g., for 20 test 1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f\u2026\u202f20).  \n- A number *n* is a factor of 20 if 20 \u00f7 *n* leaves no remainder.  \n- Remember that 1 and the number itself are always factors.\n\nWrite your answers in the space below (or just say the lists and the HCF).
