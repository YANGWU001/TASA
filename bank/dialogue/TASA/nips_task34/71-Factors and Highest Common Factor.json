List **all** positive factors of **54**.  \n2. List **all** positive factors of **72** (you can use the same method you used for 48\u202f&\u202f64).  \n3. Identify the numbers that appear in **both** lists \u2013 those are the *common factors*.  \n4. Pick the **largest** common factor \u2013 that is the HCF.\n\nOnly the first bullet is done, so we\u2019ll give you a little help to get the rest done.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 HCF of 54 and 72 (with gentle scaffolding)**  \n\nBelow are the steps you should follow. Fill in the blanks, and then check your answer with the prime\u2011factor method (optional but useful).\n\n| Step | What to do | Your answer |\n|------|------------|-------------|\n| **a** | Write the complete list of positive factors of **54**. (Start at 1 and go up to 54.) | \u2026 |\n| **b** | Write the complete list of positive factors of **72**. | \u2026 |\n| **c** | Circle every number that appears in **both** lists \u2013 these are the common factors. | \u2026 |\n| **d** | Identify the **largest** circled number. This is the HCF. | \u2026 |\n| **e** *(optional check)* | Prime\u2011factorise each number: <br>\u2011 54 =\u202f_____ <br>\u2011 72 =\u202f_____ <br>Multiply the primes they share (using the smallest exponent for each) and see if you get the same HCF as in step\u202fd. | \u2026 |\n\n**Hints to help you finish the lists**\n\n*Factors of 54* \u2013 remember that a factor comes in pairs: if *a*\u202f\u00d7\u202f*b*\u202f=\u202f54, then both *a* and *b* are factors. Start with the small numbers:\n\n- 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f54 \u2192 1,\u202f54  \n- 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f27 \u2192 2,\u202f27  \n- 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f18 \u2192 3,\u202f18  \n- 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 \u2192 6,\u202f9  \n\n(That\u2019s all the pairs; you now have the full list.)\n\n*Factors of 72* \u2013 do the same pairing:\n\n- 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f72 \u2192 1,\u202f72  \n- 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f36 \u2192 2,\u202f36  \n- 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f24 \u2192 3,\u202f24  \n- 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f18 \u2192 4,\u202f18  \n- 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f12 \u2192 6,\u202f12  \n- 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f9 \u2192 8,\u202f9  \n\nNow you have every factor of 72.\n\n**When you\u2019ve filled in the table, write your final answer here:**\n\n> **HCF of\u202f54\u202fand\u202f72 = \u2026**\n\nTake a moment, double\u2011check each number by dividing 54 and 72 (no remainders), and then pick the biggest one.

You\u2019ve already shown you can start the list (you recognised the \u201cFactors\u201d heading), so we\u2019ll build on that by giving you a **step\u2011by\u2011step scaffold** that leaves no guesswork.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 a guided HCF problem**\n\nLet\u2019s work with a slightly smaller pair of numbers so the factor lists are short, but we\u2019ll still practice the whole routine (list \u2192 compare \u2192 pick the largest).  \n\n**Find the HCF of\u202f30\u202fand\u202f45.**\n\nFollow the table below and fill in each blank. I\u2019ve added extra hints after every row to keep you moving forward.\n\n| Step | What to do | Your answer (fill in) | Hint |\n|------|------------|-----------------------|------|\n| **a** | List **all** positive factors of **30** (start at 1, end at 30). | \u2026 | Use factor\u2011pairs: 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f30, 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f15, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f10, 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f6. |\n| **b** | List **all** positive factors of **45**. | \u2026 | Use factor\u2011pairs: 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f45, 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f15, 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f9. |\n| **c** | Circle the numbers that appear in **both** lists \u2013 these are the *common factors*. | \u2026 | Compare the two rows; write the common ones. |\n| **d** | Write the **largest** common factor \u2013 that is the HCF. | \u2026 | The biggest number you circled in step\u202fc. |\n| **e** *(optional \u2013 quick check)* | Write the prime\u2011factorisation of each number and use it to recompute the HCF. | 30 =\u202f_____\u2003\u200372 =\u202f_____ | 30 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 ; 45 = 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5. Multiply the shared primes with the smallest exponents. |\n\n**When you\u2019ve completed the table, write your final answer here:**\n\n> **HCF of\u202f30\u202fand\u202f45 = \u2026**\n\n---\n\n### How to verify each step\n\n1. **Divisibility check** \u2013 for any number you list, divide 30 (or 45) by it. If the remainder is 0, it\u2019s a true factor.\n2. **Prime\u2011factor check** \u2013 the product of the common primes (with the lowest powers) must equal the HCF you found in step\u202fd. If the two results match, you\u2019re confident you\u2019re correct.\n\n---\n\n### Quick example (you don\u2019t need to copy this, just to see the pattern)\n\n- Factors of 30: **1,\u202f2,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f6,\u202f10,\u202f15,\u202f30**  \n- Factors of 45: **1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f9,\u202f15,\u202f45**  \n- Common factors: **1,\u202f3,\u202f5,\u202f15** \u2192 **largest = 15**  \n- Prime\u2011factor check: 30\u202f=\u202f2\u00b73\u00b75,\u200345\u202f=\u202f3\u00b2\u00b75 \u2192 shared primes = 3\u00b75\u202f=\u202f15.\n\nYou\u2019ll do the same work for 30 &\u202f45.  \n\nGive it a try\u2014fill in the blanks, and let me know what you get. If you get stuck at any row, just tell me which step, and I\u2019ll give a targeted hint. You\u2019ve already shown you can start a factor list; now we\u2019ll finish it together! \ud83c\udf1f",
