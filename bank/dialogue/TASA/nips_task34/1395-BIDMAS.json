So the brackets become **(11)**.\n\n2. **Indices** \u2013 already taken care of in step\u202f1.\n\n3. **Multiplication before addition** \u2013 according to BIDMAS, after the brackets are resolved we must do any multiplication or division **before** we add or subtract.  \n   The expression is now \\(2 + 3 \\times 11\\).  \n   \\(3 \\times 11 = 33\\).\n\n4. **Addition** \u2013 finally add the remaining 2:  \n   \\(2 + 33 = 35\\).\n\nSo the correct value is **35**.\n\nWhy the \u201c55\u201d route is wrong:  \nIf you added the 2 and the 3 first you would be ignoring the rule that multiplication comes before addition. That would give \\( (2+3) \\times 11 = 5 \\times 11 = 55\\), which violates the order\u2011of\u2011operations hierarchy.\n\nGreat job recognising the steps!
