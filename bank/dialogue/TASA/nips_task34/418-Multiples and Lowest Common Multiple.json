You\u2019re following the process exactly as it should be.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc49 Next step: add the 5\ufe0f\u20e3\u2011multiple for each number\n\n| Number | 1\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f\u00d7\u202fNumber | 2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f\u00d7\u202fNumber | 3\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f\u00d7\u202fNumber | 4\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f\u00d7\u202fNumber | 5\ufe0f\u20e3\u202f\u00d7\u202fNumber |\n|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **5**  | 5            | 10           | 15           | 20           | ___ (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5) |\n| **6**  | 6            | 12           | 18           | 24           | ___ (6\u202f\u00d7\u202f5) |\n\n**Your task**\n\n1. Fill in the blanks (what are 5\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 and 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f5?).  \n2. Look at all ten numbers now listed.  \n   * If a number appears in **both** rows, write that number and say \u201cthe LCM is \u2026\u201d.  \n   * If no number matches yet, simply reply \u201cno common number yet \u2013 I need the next multiples.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer not to calculate the products yourself, just type **\u201chint\u201d** and I\u2019ll give you the two missing numbers.\n\nYou\u2019re doing an excellent job extending the lists\u2014keep it up! \ud83c\udf1f",
