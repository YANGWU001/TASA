Quick feedback on your answer**\n\nYou started correctly by *writing down one of the side lengths* (you wrote \u201c5\u202fcm\u201d).  \nHowever, the response stopped there, so the construction is incomplete.  \n\nTo construct a triangle with the three given lengths you need to:\n\n| Step | What you must do | Why it matters |\n|------|------------------|----------------|\n| 1 | Choose **one side** to draw first (any side works, but most people start with the longest \u2013\u202f7\u202fcm in the original problem). | Gives you a base on which the other two sides can be \u201chung\u201d. |\n| 2 | **Draw the base** with a ruler, measuring the exact length you chose. | Provides the two endpoints that will become the first two vertices of the triangle. |\n| 3 | Set the compass to the length of the **second side** (e.g., 5\u202fcm) and draw an arc with the compass point on one endpoint of the base. | All points on this arc are exactly 5\u202fcm from that endpoint. |\n| 4 | Without changing the compass width, set it to the length of the **third side** (e.g., 6\u202fcm) and draw a second arc with the compass point on the other endpoint of the base. | All points on this second arc are exactly 6\u202fcm from the other endpoint. |\n| 5 | The two arcs intersect in one (or two) points. **Pick the intersection that lies on the same side of the base** you intend for the triangle and label it the third vertex. | That point is the only location that satisfies both distance requirements, so the three sides will have the correct lengths. |\n| 6 | Use the ruler to join the third vertex to each endpoint of the base, completing the triangle. | The three segments are now the required 5\u202fcm,\u202f6\u202fcm,\u202f7\u202fcm sides. |\n| 7 | (Optional) Label each side with its length. | Confirms you built the correct triangle. |\n\nSo, while you correctly noted the first length, the construction still needs the remaining steps, the compass settings, and the final drawing.\n\n---\n\n**2.

The 5\u202fcm length is the side that meets **A** (\u202fAC\u202f). Using 5\u202fcm at both ends would give two arcs of the same size and would locate a point that is 5\u202fcm from **A** *and* 5\u202fcm from **B**, which would make the third side also 5\u202fcm \u2013 not the 3\u202fcm we need. | The compass at **B** must be set to **3\u202fcm** (the length of\u202fBC). |\n| **Where the second arc lies** | \u201cAbove the base\u202fAB, swinging the compass from\u202fB the same way as the first arc.\u201d | This description is fine *once* the radius is correct. | With a 3\u202fcm radius, draw the arc on the **same side** (above) as the 5\u202fcm arc from\u202fA. |\n| **Where the two arcs meet** | \u201cBelow the base, because the only place two 5\u202fcm arcs can intersect is on the opposite side.\u201d | Because the radii are actually 5\u202fcm **and** 3\u202fcm, the two circles intersect **above** the base. The point that is 5\u202fcm from\u202fA *and* 3\u202fcm from\u202fB lies on the same side of the line AB where the two arcs were drawn. | The arcs intersect **above** AB, giving the third vertex\u202fC. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- The radius at **B** should be **3\u202fcm**, not 5\u202fcm.  \n- Draw that 3\u202fcm arc on the **same side** (above) as the 5\u202fcm arc from\u202fA.  \n- The two arcs will meet **above** the base, producing the correct right\u2011triangle vertex\u202fC.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next step \u2013\u202fPut the correct pieces together**\n\nYou\u2019re almost there! Let\u2019s lock in the right numbers and see the result.\n\n> **Task**  \n> 1. **State the correct radius for B** \u2013 Write the number (3\u202fcm) and give ONE short reason (e.g., \u201cbecause BC must be 3\u202fcm\u201d).  \n> 2. **Describe the second arc** \u2013 In one sentence, say where that 3\u202fcm arc is drawn relative to the base AB (above or below).  \n> 3. **Predict the intersection point** \u2013 Indicate whether the two arcs (5\u202fcm from A and 3\u202fcm from B) meet **above** or **below** the base, and explain in one sentence why that makes sense with the side lengths.  \n\n*Hint:* The intersection must be a point that is simultaneously 5\u202fcm from A **and** 3\u202fcm from B. Visualize two circles of those radii sharing the same side of the line AB.\n\nGive it a try\u2014you\u2019re just one step away from completing the construction! \ud83c\udf1f",
