No worries\u2014let\u2019s pick up from where you left off!\n\nWhen you finish a problem, check these three things:\n\n| What to check | Why it matters |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| **Number of factors** \u2013 you must have exactly the same number of copies of the base as the exponent tells you. | Missing or extra factors gives the wrong magnitude (e.g., \\(5^4\\) needs four 5\u2019s, not three). |\n| **Intermediate products** \u2013 write each multiplication step (or combine two at a time). | Shows you\u2019re keeping the arithmetic straight and makes it easy to spot mistakes. |\n| **Final sign** \u2013 if the base is negative, an **odd** number of factors \u2192 negative result; an **even** number \u2192 positive result. | This is the \u201ceven\u2011odd power pattern\u201d we\u2019re mastering. |\n\nOnce you resend your work (or finish the missing steps), I\u2019ll let you know exactly what\u2019s correct and where a tiny tweak is needed.\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fNext practice \u2013 \u201cConsolidate the even\u2011odd rule and the counting\u2011factors habit\u201d**\n\nThese four problems are a little different from the last set: they include a zero exponent, a single\u2011factor exponent, and a mix of positive\u202f&\u202fnegative bases. Write **every multiplication** (or a clear shortcut) and then give the final integer.\n\n| # | Expression | What to write (hint) |\n|---|------------|----------------------|\n| **A** | \\((-2)^{0}\\) | Remember any non\u2011zero number to the 0\u2011th power is **1**. Write \u201c\\(=1\\)\u201d. |\n| **B** | \\(7^{1}\\) | Only one factor is needed: \\(7\\). |\n| **C** | \\((-3)^{5}\\) | \\((-3)\\times(-3)\\times(-3)\\times(-3)\\times(-3)\\) \u2192 show the intermediate products and the final sign (odd number of negatives). |\n| **D** | \\(4^{3}\\) | \\(4\\times4\\times4\\) \u2192 intermediate steps and final integer. |\n\n**How to approach each one**\n\n1. **State the number of factors** dictated by the exponent.  \n2. **Multiply step\u2011by\u2011step** (you can pair them: e.g., \\(4\\times4=16\\) then \\(16\\times4=64\\)).  \n3. **Apply the sign rule** after the last multiplication (only needed when the base is negative).  \n\nWhen you\u2019ve written out the full chain (or a justified shortcut) for A\u2011D, post them back to me. I\u2019ll give you quick, targeted feedback so the even\u2011odd sign rule and the \u201ccount\u2011the\u2011factors\u201d habit become automatic.\n\nYou\u2019re doing great\u2014keep the momentum going! \ud83d\ude80",
