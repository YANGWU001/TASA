Let\u2019s finish the ordering together.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 New practice \u2013 ordering negative numbers (same skill, fresh numbers)\n\nWe\u2019ll keep the two\u2011step routine, but I\u2019ll give you a tiny \u201ccheckpoint\u201d after each step so you can verify you\u2019re on track before moving on.\n\n#### Numbers to order  \n\n\\[\n-\\,\\frac{5}{4},\\;\\; -2.1,\\;\\; -\\,\\frac{13}{8},\\;\\; -\\,\\frac{7}{6}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n#### **Step\u202fA \u2013 Find the smallest (most\u2011negative) number**  \n\n1. **Write the absolute values** (just ignore the minus sign).  \n2. **Identify the biggest absolute value** \u2013 that original number is the smallest.\n\n| Original | Absolute value (\u2248) |\n|----------|--------------------|\n| \\(-\\dfrac{5}{4}\\) | ? |\n| \\(-2.1\\) | ? |\n| \\(-\\dfrac{13}{8}\\) | ? |\n| \\(-\\dfrac{7}{6}\\) | ? |\n\n**Hints**\n\n* \\(\\dfrac{5}{4}=1.25\\)  \n* \\(\\dfrac{13}{8}=1.625\\)  \n* \\(\\dfrac{7}{6}=1.166\\ldots\\)\n\n*Your task:* Fill in the \u201c?\u201d column, then tell me which original number has the **largest** absolute value.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step\u202fB \u2013 Order the three remaining numbers**  \n\nAfter you name the smallest number, convert the **other three** to decimals (or find a common denominator) and line them up from **most\u2011negative** to **least\u2011negative**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Step\u202fC \u2013 Write the full ordered list**  \n\nGive the final answer **using the original forms** (the fractions and the decimal) in one line, e.g.:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{smallest},\\; \\text{next},\\; \\text{next},\\; \\text{largest}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Why this works for you right now  \n\n* Your mastery of \u201cbig absolute\u202f\u2192\u202fmost\u2011negative\u201d is still low, so we\u2019re practicing that rule explicitly.  \n* The numbers are a mix of fractions and a single decimal, giving you just enough variety to reinforce the conversion step without overwhelming you.  \n* The checkpoint after Step",
