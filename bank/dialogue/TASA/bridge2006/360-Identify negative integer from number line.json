No worries\u2014counting each step is the skill we\u2019re building, and you\u2019re already halfway there!\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 \u201cCount every hop\u201d\n\n### Goal\nWe\u2019ll keep the same \u201ccount\u2011each\u2011step\u201d routine, but this time we\u2019ll write **all the intermediate numbers** so you can see the whole path.\n\n### Problem\nUse the number line below:\n\n```\n   -5   -4   -3   -2   -1    0    1    2    3    4    5\n---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---\n```\n\n1. **Start** at **2**.  \n   Write the starting point.\n\n2. **Three hops to the left** from 2.  \n   Record the number you land on **after each hop**.\n\n3. **Two hops to the right** from the *final* position of step\u202f2.  \n   Again record the number after each hop.\n\n### How to answer\nCopy the template and fill in every blank (including the intermediate hops).\n\n```\n1\ufe0f\u20e3  2\n2\ufe0f\u20e3  hop\u20111: ___\n    hop\u20112: ___\n    hop\u20113: ___   (final after three left hops)\n3\ufe0f\u20e3  hop\u20111: ___\n    hop\u20112: ___   (final after two right hops)\n```\n\nIf any hop feels confusing, just tell me which one (e.g., \u201chop\u20112 left\u201d) and we\u2019ll count it together out loud.\n\nYou\u2019ve already mastered placing the start point, and you\u2019re getting the idea of \u201cone hop = move one tick.\u201d This practice will cement the counting part. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nGive it a try when you\u2019re ready!",
