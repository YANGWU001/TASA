Each cell is either **shaded** (marked with **X**) or **unshaded** (marked with a dot **\u00b7**).\n\n```\nRow\u202f1:  X  X  \u00b7  \u00b7  .\nRow\u202f2:  X  X  \u00b7  X  X\nRow\u202f3:  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  X  X\nRow\u202f4:  .  X  X  X  .\nRow\u202f5:  .  X  .  .  .\n```\n\n(You can also picture the grid as a picture of squares, but the text representation above contains all the information you need.)\n\n**Your task:**  \nCount how many **separate contiguous shaded parts** (i.e., groups of X\u2011cells that touch each other **horizontally or vertically**) are present in the grid.\n\n*Remember:* Cells that only touch at a corner **do not** count as being in the same group.\n\n---\n\n### How to answer\n\n1. Look at the grid and identify each cluster of X\u2019s that are connected side\u2011to\u2011side.  \n2. Count each distinct cluster once.  \n3. Write the total number of contiguous shaded parts.\n\n*Feel free to sketch the grid on paper and label each group with a different color or number to help you keep track.*",
