Both numbers are the same size  \nD. There isn\u2019t a larger quantity; they are equal in this context  \n\n---\n\n### What the question is testing\nYou need to look at the two factors (5 and 3) and decide which one is larger. This skill helps you interpret multiplication situations, such as \u201c5 groups of 3 objects\u201d versus \u201c3 groups of 5 objects.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Answer (for you to check after you try)\n\n**Correct answer: A. 5**  \n\n**Why?**  \n- The two factors are 5 and 3.  \n- Since 5\u202f>\u202f3, the larger quantity being multiplied is **5**.  \n\nIf you chose a different option, think about the size of each number and compare them directly.  \n\n---\n\n**Next step:**  \nIf you felt comfortable with this, you\u2019ll be ready for a slightly harder one that involves a word\u2011problem context. If you struggled, review comparing two numbers (e.g., \u201cWhich is bigger: 7 or 2?\u201d) before moving on. Keep practicing!",
