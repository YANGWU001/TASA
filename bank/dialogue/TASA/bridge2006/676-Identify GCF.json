Among these, **6** is the largest, so the GCF = **6**. |\n| **Prime factorization** | 12\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3  <br> 18\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 | The *common* prime factors are one **2** and one **3**.  Multiply them: 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f6.  That product is the greatest common factor. |\n\nWhy 6, not 3?  \n- A factor is a number that divides *exactly* into the original number. Both 12 and 18 are divisible by 6 (12\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f2, 18\u202f\u00f7\u202f6\u202f=\u202f3).  \n- 3 is also a common factor, but it is *smaller* than 6. The \u201cgreatest\u201d common factor is the **largest** number that works for both, which is 6.  \n- Being a multiple of another common factor (e.g., 6\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3) does **not** disqualify it; it actually shows that 6 contains all the prime factors they share.\n\nSo the correct GCF of 12 and 18 is **6**. Great job listing the factors and writing the prime factorizations\u2014you just need to remember to pick the *largest* common one.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 reinforcing the \u201cgreatest\u201d step\n\n### Question\n\n**Find the greatest common factor of 20 and 30.**  \n\nShow your work using **one** of the following methods (pick the one you feel most comfortable with):\n\n1. **List the factors** of each number, then identify the largest common factor.  \n2. **Prime factorization** \u2013 break each number into its prime factors and multiply the primes they share.\n\n**Helpful hint:**  \n- If you use listing, write the full factor list for each number first; then look at the *intersection* and pick the biggest number in that intersection.  \n- If you use prime factorization, remember that the GCF is the product of *all* prime factors that appear in **both** factorizations, taking each common prime the **minimum** number of times it occurs.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type your answer (e.g., \u201cThe GCF is 10\u201d) and, if you like, include the factor list or the prime\u2011factor steps you used.  \n\nIf any step feels shaky, just ask for a quick hint\u2014I\u2019m here to help you lock down the \u201cgreatest\u201d part! \ud83c\udf1f",

This will give you a second way to see why the answer is the largest common divisor.\n\n### Question\n\n**Find the greatest common factor of 45 and 60.**  \n\nDo the following:\n\n1. Write each number as a product of prime factors.  \n2. Identify the primes that appear in **both** factorizations.  \n3. Multiply those common primes (using each common prime the *minimum* number of times it occurs) to get the GCF.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type your answer (e.g., \u201cThe GCF is 15\u201d) and, if you like, show the prime\u2011factor steps you used.\n\n---\n\n**Quick hint if you get stuck**\n\n- **45** \u2192 45\u202f=\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f9\u202f=\u202f5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 \u2192 **3\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f5**  \n- **60** \u2192 60\u202f=\u202f6\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 \u2192 **2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u202f\u00b7\u202f5**  \n\nLook for the primes that appear in **both** factorizations (that\u2019s the \u201cintersection\u201d of the prime sets). Then multiply the *smallest* power of each common prime.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know how it goes! \ud83c\udf1f",
