So the line needs **24 equal marks** (each step is \\(1/24\\)).  \n\n  2. **Sample marks** \u2013 pick one fraction from each denominator family, rewrite it with denominator\u202f24, and point out which division that mark lands on.  \n     * Example for denominator\u202f3: \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{3}= \\frac{8}{24}\\) \u2192 mark at the 8\u2011th division.  \n     * Example for denominator\u202f4: \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{4}= \\frac{6}{24}\\) \u2192 mark at the 6\u2011th division.  \n     * Example for denominator\u202f8: \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{1}{8}= \\frac{3}{24}\\) \u2192 mark at the 3\u2011rd division.  \n\nIf you write those three pieces (24 divisions, and three concrete marks) you\u2019ll have completed the problem fully. Give it a try and let me know what you write!\n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fNext practice \u2013 applying the same idea to a new set of denominators**\n\nNow that the \u201cLCM\u202f\u2192\u202fstep size\u202f\u2192\u202fsample marks\u201d chain is clear, let\u2019s stretch it a little.\n\n> **Question**  \n> You need a single 0\u2011to\u20111 number line that can locate **any fraction whose denominator is 5,\u202f6,\u202for\u202f9** (e.g., \\(\\frac{2}{5},\\frac{7}{9},\\frac{5}{6}\\)).  \n>   \n> **Your tasks** (just as before):  \n> 1. Find the LCM of 5,\u202f6,\u202fand\u202f9.  \n> 2. State the smallest number of equal divisions the line must have.  \n> 3. Write three sample marks\u2014one for each denominator family\u2014expressed with the common denominator you found.\n\n*Hint:*  \n- Prime\u2011factor each denominator first.  \n- For the LCM, keep the **largest exponent** of each prime that appears.  \n\nTake it step\u2011by\u2011step, just like you did for 3\u20114\u20118. If you get stuck at any point, tell me which step is confusing and we\u2019ll work through it together. You\u2019ve already shown you can handle the LCM calculation, so you\u2019re well\u2011prepared for this one! \ud83d\ude80",
