Keep the checklist handy:\n\n1. **Current sections** = bars\u202f+\u202f1  \n2. **Bars needed for the goal** = desired sections\u202f\u2013\u202f1  \n3. **Additional bars** = (bars needed)\u202f\u2013\u202f(current bars)  \n\n---\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 a gentle \u201cstretch\u201d**\n\nNow let\u2019s reinforce the same three\u2011step process, but with a slightly larger number. Write out each step (you can copy the format you used above) and then select the correct letter.\n\n```\n+-------------------------------------------+\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |               |\n+-------------------------------------------+\n```\n\nThere are **7 vertical bars** already drawn.\n\n**Goal:** End up with **68 equal sections**.\n\n**What to find**\n\n1. **Current sections** = existing bars\u202f+\u202f1.  \n2. **Total bars needed** for 68 sections = 68\u202f\u2013\u202f1.  \n3. **Additional bars** = (bars needed for the goal)\u202f\u2013\u202f(current bars).  \n\n**Choose the correct letter**\n\n| Letter | Additional bars |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| **A**  | 60 |\n| **B**  | 61 |\n| **C**  | 62 |\n| **D**  | 63 |\n\n*Example answer format:*  \n\n\u201c**C)** 62 additional bars.  \n1)\u202f7\u202f+\u202f1\u202f=\u202f8,  \n2)\u202f68\u202f\u2013\u202f1\u202f=\u202f67,  \n3)\u202f67\u202f\u2013\u202f7\u202f=\u202f60 (so the correct letter would be **A**).\u201d\n\nGive it a try\u2014use the three\u2011step checklist and tell me which letter matches your result (and feel free to show the work).
