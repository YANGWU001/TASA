Here the average of the factors in A is \\((4+6)/2 = 5\\), the same as the average in B, but because the two numbers in A are *different* the product is a little smaller than the square of the average.\n\n---\n\n## Next practice \u2013 a little easier, but still builds the same skill\n\nCompare the two expressions. **Without calculating the exact products**, decide which one is larger (or if they are equal) and write **A**, **B**, or **Equal**.
