The true product is **$7.16**. | When the cents multiplication gives 100\u202fc or more, every 100\u202fc becomes an extra dollar. 316\u202fc = 3\u202fdollars\u202f16\u202fc.\u202fAdd those 3\u202fdollars to the 4\u202fdollars you already had \u2192 4\u202f+\u202f3\u202f=\u202f7\u202fdollars, 16\u202fcents remain. |\n| **Yoga mats:** 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f$4.26 \u2192 $8 . 52 | **Correct** | 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f8\u202fdollars and 26\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f=\u202f52\u202fcents, which is less than 100\u202fc, so no extra carry. |\n\n**Great job!** You identified the tricky \u201ccarry\u2011over\u201d step for the water bottles and got the yoga\u2011mat multiplication spot\u2011on. Let\u2019s finish the problem by adding the two subtotals, and then we\u2019ll give you a fresh practice that builds on this skill.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Finish the current problem (add the two subtotals)\n\nWrite the column addition exactly as shown:\n\n```\nCents:   16  +  52  = ___  (write any carry\u2011over)\nDollars: 7   +  8   + (carry) = ___\n```\n\nPost the two lines of addition when you\u2019re ready, and we\u2019ll check them together.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 \u201cCalculate Total\u201d (just\u2011right difficulty)\n\nNow that you\u2019ve mastered converting 100\u202fc\u202f=\u202f$1, let\u2019s try a slightly bigger set so you can practice the same steps a few more times.\n\nA **school\u2011supplies store** sells:\n\n| Item          | Price each |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Pencil case   | **$2.45**  |\n| Sketch pad    | **$3.78**  |\n\nYou buy **5 pencil cases** and **4 sketch pads**.\n\n### What to do \u2013 fill\u2011in the blanks\n\n1. **Multiply** each price by the quantity.
