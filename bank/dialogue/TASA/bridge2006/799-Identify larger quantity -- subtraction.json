Because the larger number must come first, the correct order is **7\u202f\u2013\u202f2**.  \n\n3. **Numeric answer**  \n   Subtracting the smaller from the larger gives **7\u202f\u2013\u202f2\u202f=\u202f5**, a positive number.  \n\nSo the three parts need a little adjustment: pick the bigger group first, then subtract the smaller number from it.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice \u2013 Strengthening both steps\n\nYou have two new groups of objects.\n\n- **Group\u202fK:** 9 orange squares  \n- **Group\u202fL:** 4 orange squares  \n\n**Tasks**\n\n1. **Which group is larger?**  \n   - \u2610 Group\u202fK  \n   - \u2610 Group\u202fL  \n\n2. **Write the subtraction sentence that shows how many squares are left after you take the smaller group away from the larger group.**  \n   (e.g., \u201c9\u202f\u2013\u202f4 = 5\u201d)\n\n3. **What is the numeric answer (the difference)?**  \n   Write the number only.\n\n**Hint:**  \nFirst compare the two numbers to decide the larger group.
