Write the prime factorizations:  \n   - 8\u202f=\u202f2\u00b3  \n   - 12\u202f=\u202f2\u00b2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u00b9\n2. Take the highest power of each prime that appears:  \n   - 2\u00b3 (from 8) and 3\u00b9 (from 12)\n3. Multiply them: 2\u00b3\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u00b9\u202f=\u202f8\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f**24**\n\n**So the LCM of 8 and 12 is 24.**  \n*One\u2011sentence explanation:* \u201cThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes that appear in either factor, i.e., 2\u00b3\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f24.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Next practice \u2013 reinforcing the prime\u2011factor method\n\nNow that the \u201clarger\u202f=\u202fLCM\u201d rule feels solid, let\u2019s stretch a little more with a pair that **are not multiples of each other**. You\u2019ll use the prime\u2011factor method we just reviewed.\n\n> **Numbers:** 14 and **__**  \n> The least common multiple of the pair is **42**.  \n> What is the missing number?\n\n**Hints (feel free to use any or all of them):**\n\n1. **Factor each number into primes.**  \n   - 14\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00b7\u202f7  \n   - 42\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00b7\u202f3\u202f\u00b7\u202f7\n2. The LCM must contain **every prime factor that appears in either number**, using the **largest exponent** of each prime.\n3. Since the LCM already includes the prime 3, the missing number must supply that factor.  \n   \u2013 Think: which prime factor(s) are missing from 14 to reach the full set {2,\u202f3,\u202f7}?\n4. Multiply the needed prime(s) together to get the missing number.\n\n**What to write**\n\n- The missing number (a single integer).  \n- One short sentence explaining how the prime\u2011factor rule tells you that this is the correct number.\n\n---\n\n### Why this question is a good fit\n\n- **Retention check:** You\u2019ve shown you can pick the larger number when the pair are multiples.  \n- **New skill:** This problem forces you to apply the prime\u2011factor rule, reinforcing the concept that the LCM is built from the highest powers of all primes involved.  \n- **Scaffolded hints:** They guide you step\u2011by\u2011step without giving the answer away, helping the knowledge move from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cstrong\u201d retention.\n\nGive it a try, and when you\u2019re ready, share your answer and reasoning. I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll nail it! \ud83c\udf89",
