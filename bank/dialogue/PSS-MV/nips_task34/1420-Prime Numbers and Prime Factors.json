If yes, divide by 2 and write down the factor.  \n2. **Repeat with the quotient** you get after each division.  \n   - Keep asking, \u201cIs the current number still divisible by 2?\u201d until it isn\u2019t.  \n3. **Move to the next smallest prime (3).**  \n   - Test whether the current number is divisible by 3 (you can add the digits or just try dividing).  \n4. **Continue with the next primes (5, 7, 11, \u2026)** as needed, always dividing only when the division is exact (no remainder).  \n5. **Stop when the remaining quotient is itself a prime number.**  \n\n**Write down each factor you discover in order**, and at the end multiply all the prime factors you listed to verify that you get back to 84.\n\n---\n\n**When you\u2019re ready, reply with the list of prime factors you found and a brief note of each division step you performed.** If you get stuck at any",
