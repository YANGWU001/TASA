Can you tell me:**\n> \n> 1. What a *multiple* of a number means, in your own words?  \n> 2. How you would go about finding the **lowest common multiple** of those two numbers, step by step.  \n> \n> If any part of the process feels unclear, let me know exactly where you get stuck, and I\u2019ll walk you through that piece with a tailored explanation (visual, numeric, or a real\u2011life analogy\u2014whatever you prefer).\n\nFeel free to pick any pair of numbers you like, and share your thoughts! \ud83d\ude80",
