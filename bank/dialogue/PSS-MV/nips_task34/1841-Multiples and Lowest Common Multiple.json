Multiples are the products *n \u00d7 k* where *k* is an integer (\u2026\u202f0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f\u2026) | It\u2019s helpful to say **\u201cinteger\u201d** (including negative numbers) rather than just \u201cwhole\u2011number,\u201d because the definition works for negatives too (e.g., \u201312 is also a multiple of 4). |\n| \u201c12 is a multiple of\u202f4 because 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f=\u202f12.\u201d | Perfect example. | None needed! |\n| \u201c0 is a multiple of every number, but I\u2019m not completely sure why that works.\u201d | You\u2019re right\u20140 *is* a multiple of every integer. | Let\u2019s make the \u201cwhy\u201d crystal clear: 0 = *n* \u00d7 0 for any integer *n*. Since the multiplier (0) is an integer, the product (0) fits the definition of a multiple. |\n\n**Takeaway:**  \n- Multiples = *n*\u202f\u00d7\u202f*k* where *k* \u2208 \u2124 (\u2026\u202f\u20132,\u202f\u20131,\u202f0,\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f\u2026).  \n- Because 0 = *n* \u00d7 0, 0 qualifies as a multiple of every integer *n*.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Quick \u201ccheck\u2011understanding",
