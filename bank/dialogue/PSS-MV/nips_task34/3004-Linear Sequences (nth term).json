Do this for a few pairs; the result should be constant.  \n3. **Name that constant** \u2013 It\u2019s called the **common difference** (often denoted by \\(d\\)). Once you have \\(d\\), you can use it to write the formula for the nth term.\n\n---\n\n### Next Question (personalized for you)\n\n**Take the first four terms of the sequence you were given: 3,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f15.**\n\n1.

Write down what you notice about those differences.  \n\n*Feel free to type out the numbers you get and a short sentence describing the pattern.*  \n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ll move on to building the nth\u2011term formula together.
