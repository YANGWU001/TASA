Nothing moves left or right, so the **x\u2011coordinate does NOT change**.\n\n3. **What flips?**  \n   The distance above the line becomes the same distance **below** the line (and vice\u2011versa). In algebraic terms, if the line is *y = k*, a point *(x,\u202fy)* goes to *(x,\u202f2k\u202f\u2013\u202fy)*.  \n   - If the line is the *x\u2011axis* (*k = 0*), that formula simplifies to *(x,\u202f\u2013y)* \u2013 the y\u2011value just changes sign.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Applying it to your point **P(\u20113,\u202f4)**\n\n- **Step\u202f1: Identify the line**  \n  From the conversation it sounds like H is the *x\u2011axis* (the classic \u201chorizontal line through the origin\u201d).
