For example:\n\n- Have you worked with vectors on a coordinate grid before?\n- Do you have an idea of what a translation (sliding a shape without rotating it) looks like?\n- Is there a real\u2011world situation\u2014like moving a game character or shifting a map\u2014that helps you picture these ideas?\n\nAnd just so I can tailor our sessions to the way you learn best, do you find it most helpful to:\n- see lots of diagrams and visual step\u2011by\u2011step drawings,\n- work through concrete examples and real\u2011world scenarios,\n- or break things down with detailed written explanations and practice problems?\n\nYour answers will help me give you the personalized guidance you need. \ud83c\udf1f",
