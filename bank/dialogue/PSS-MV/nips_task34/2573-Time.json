You\u2019ve correctly identified **clocks** and the idea that we use **hours/minutes** when we look at a clock. That\u2019s one of the three common ways we talk about time.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the full picture, piece by piece, so you can see exactly what\u2019s missing and why each part belongs in the list.\n\n| # | What we use to **measure or describe** time | Typical units / examples | Why it\u2019s useful in everyday life |\n|---|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 1 | **Clocks / watches** (the \u201cclock\u2011face\u201d method) | Hours, minutes, seconds (e.g., 3:45\u202fpm) | Lets us schedule appointments, know when a TV show starts, etc. |\n| 2 | **Calendars** (the \u201cdate\u201d method) | Days, weeks, months, years (e.g., 12\u202fOct\u202f2025) | Helps us plan events that are far apart, remember birthdays, pay bills, etc. |\n| 3 | **Durations / elapsed time** (the \u201chow long\u201d method) | Seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc., but expressed as a length of time (e.g., \u201cthe movie lasts 2\u202fhours 15\u202fminutes\u201d) | Lets us compare activities, know how much time we have left, time travel (e.g., \u201cI walked for 30\u202fminutes\u201d) |\n\nYou already have **#1** (clocks). The other two are **calendars** (dates) and **durations** (how long something lasts). Notice how each one uses a different *focus*:\n\n* **Clock time** tells **when** something happens (a point on the daily cycle).  \n* **Calendar dates** tell **when** something happens on a larger scale (a point in the year).  \n* **Durations** tell **how long** something lasts (a length of time).\n\nNow that the three are clear, let\u2019s make sure you can recognize each one in everyday examples.\n\n---\n\n### Next question \u2013 still step\u2011by\u2011step\n\n**Identify the",
