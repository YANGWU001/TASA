It\u2019s totally fine to feel stuck at the beginning \u2013 the most important thing is that you\u2019re here and ready to learn.

That \u201cone number\u201d is called a *factor* of 12.  \n\n2. **Why start small?**  \n   Working with a single, easy number lets us see the idea clearly before we add more numbers or more steps. Think of it like learning to ride a bike with training wheels first \u2013 you\u2019ll feel steadier and more confident.\n\n3. **No pressure!**  \n   If you truly have *no* idea at the moment, that\u2019s okay too.

The only time \u201cdividing\u201d shows up is in special mechanics (e.g., \u201chalve your score when you die\u201d). |\n| **Coin value** | Usually a fixed amount (e.g., each gold coin =\u202f10 points). | The game simply adds that fixed amount to whatever your score already is.
