Identify the variable that stands for the number of cupcakes.  \n2. Identify the variable that stands for the number of cookies.  \n3. Multiply each variable by its price.  \n4. Add the two results together.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, tell me the expression you get (you can write it just as you would in math, e.g.,\u202f`2c + 1.5k`).
