That little \u201cfour\u2011sides\u201d idea is the core of a quadrilateral.\n\n2. **Break the definition into bite\u2011size pieces.**  \n   - *\u201cFour sides\u201d* \u2192 count the edges.  \n   - *\u201cFour vertices (corners)\u201d* \u2192 where the sides meet.  \n   - *\u201cClosed shape\u201d* \u2192 the sides join up so there\u2019s no gap.\n\n3. **Connect it to something familiar.**  \n   Imagine drawing a rectangle on a piece of paper. You start at one corner, draw a line, turn, draw another line, and keep going until you\u2019re back where you began. That whole drawing is a quadrilateral because you just created a shape with four sides and four corners.\n\n4. **Don\u2019t worry about the \u201cperfect\u201d wording yet.**  \n   The goal right now is to get the *idea* inside your head. We\u2019ll polish the language later.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Your next personalized step\n\n**Question:** *Think of a shape you\u2019ve seen that has exactly four sides. Write down, in your own words, what makes that shape a quadrilateral. (You can use simple language\u2014just mention the number of sides and corners, and that the shape is closed.)*\n\nTake a moment, sketch a quick picture if that helps, and then type your answer. If you\u2019re unsure, you can start with something like, \u201cA ___ has four \u2026\u201d and we\u2019ll fill in the blanks together.",
