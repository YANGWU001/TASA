Identify the vertex** | You spotted the blue \u201c\u29bf\u201d tip where the two lines meet. | The vertex is the pivot point of the angle \u2013 everything is measured from here. | ![Vertex picture] \u2013 imagine a tiny dot at the corner of a slice of pizza. |\n| **2. Align the protractor\u2019s baseline** | You placed the straight edge of the protractor along one of the lines. | The baseline is the \u201czero\u2011line\u201d (0\u00b0) from which you start counting. | Think of the protractor as a ruler that starts counting from the bottom edge. |\n| **3. Read the other side** | You followed the second line up to the degree marks and read the number. | This gives the **measure** of the angle. | Picture a bright laser beam sweeping from the baseline to the second line; the number where it hits is the angle. |\n| **4. Check the direction** | You looked at the **inner** (small) angle, not the larger reflex one. | Angles have two possible measures that add to 360\u00b0; we usually take the smaller one unless told otherwise. | Visualize the blue slice as the \u201cbite\u201d you\u2019re measuring, not the whole pizza. |\n\n### How close is **\u2248\u202f40\u00b0**?\n\nIf you draw a quick mental picture of a **right angle (90\u00b0)** and then split it in half, you get **45\u00b0**. Your blue angle looks a little *smaller* than that half\u2011right\u2011angle, so **\u2248\u202f40\u00b0** is a very reasonable estimate.  \n\n**To be sure:**  \n",
