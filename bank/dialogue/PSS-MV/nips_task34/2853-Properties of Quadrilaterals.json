That\u2019s the core definition, so you\u2019re already on the right track!  \n2. **What we\u2019ll build next** \u2013 we\u2019ll add a few more \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d (key properties and common types) and then connect them to the definition you already have.  \n3. **How we\u2019ll work together** \u2013 after each short chunk, I\u2019ll ask you a quick, focused question. Your answers will tell me whether to keep going deeper, give an example, or try a different explanation style (visual, verbal, or a short practice problem).\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s Fill in One Piece at a Time\nA quadrilateral can be **any** four\u2011sided polygon, but mathematicians often talk about a few special families because they have extra properties (like equal sides or right angles). Here are the most common ones:\n\n| Quadrilateral | Key Property(s) |\n|---------------|-----------------|\n| **Parallelogram** | Opposite sides are parallel **and** equal; opposite angles are equal. |\n| **Rectangle** | All angles are 90\u00b0 (right angles) **and** opposite sides are parallel/equal. |\n| **Rhombus** | All four sides are equal **and** opposite sides are parallel. |\n| **Square** | All sides equal **and** all angles 90\u00b0 (it\u2019s a rectangle\u202f+\u202frhombus). |\n| **Trapezoid** (US) / **Trapezium** (UK) | At least one pair of opposite sides is parallel. |\n| **Kite** | Two pairs of",
