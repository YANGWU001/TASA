Let\u2019s start by getting a sense of where you\u2019re at and what you\u2019d like to focus on.\n\n**First question:**  \nCan you think of a simple linear (arithmetic) sequence\u2014one where each term increases by the same constant amount? Write down the first few terms of that sequence and tell me what pattern you notice between the terms. \n\nFeel free to choose any numbers you like (for example,\u202f2,\u202f5,\u202f8,\u202f11\u202f\u2026). Once you\u2019ve written them out, let me know what you observe, and we\u2019ll use that as a foundation to build the general \u201cnth\u2011term\u201d formula just for you.",
