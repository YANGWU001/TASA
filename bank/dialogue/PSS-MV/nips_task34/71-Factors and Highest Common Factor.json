It\u2019s useful for simplifying fractions, solving word problems, and finding common measures.\n\nNow, instead of trying to write down every factor at once, let\u2019s build the lists **step\u2011by\u2011step** together.\n\n---\n\n### Mini\u2011exercise (guided)\n\n1. **Start with the smallest possible factor \u2013\u202f1.**  \n   Does 1 divide 12?

That shows you\u2019re already building the conceptual framework; now we just need to fill in a few missing pieces and see the idea from a slightly different angle.  \n\nThink of a factor as a \u201cbuilding block\u201d that fits together with another block (another factor) to make the whole number you started with. When the blocks snap together, they *multiply* to give you the original number. If we can picture those blocks and how they combine, the definition becomes less abstract and more concrete.\n\n---\n\n### Next question \u2013 a concept\u2011focused prompt\n\n**Imagine you have a rectangular garden that is 12\u202ffeet long.**  \nYou want to divide the garden into **identical square sections** without cutting any squares in half.  \n\n1. What are the possible side\u2011lengths (in whole feet) of those squares?  \n2. For each side\u2011length you list, write the multiplication fact that shows how many squares of that size fill the whole garden.\n\n*Why this helps*:  \n- It links the idea of \u201cfactors\u201d to a visual, real\u2011world situation (the garden).  \n- You\u2019ll see directly how each side\u2011length is a factor of 12, because \u201cside\u2011length \u00d7 number\u202fof\u202fsquares = total length.\u201d  \n- Writing the multiplication fact reinforces the definition of a factor as a whole number that pairs with another whole number to produce the original number.\n\nTake a moment to picture the garden, then list the side\u2011lengths you think could work. When you\u2019re ready, share your list and the corresponding multiplication facts, and we\u2019ll discuss why each",

What are the two numbers you are multiplying?  \n2. Which of those numbers would you call a *factor*?  \n\nWrite your answer in a sentence that explains why each number fits the definition of a factor.
