Think of it as the algebraic equivalent of pulling out a common \u201cingredient\u201d that appears in every term, just as you would pull out a common ingredient when cooking a recipe.\n\nHere\u2019s the very basic idea, broken into bite\u2011size pieces:\n\n| Step | What we do | Why it works |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **1. Look for a common factor** | Identify a number or a variable that appears in **every** term. | Anything that is shared can be taken out (just like factoring out a common divisor in numbers). |\n| **2. Write that common factor outside a bracket** | Put the common factor in front of a pair of parentheses. | This shows we\u2019re \u201cfactoring it out.\u201d |\n| **3. Fill the bracket with what\u2019s left** | Inside the parentheses, write each original term **divided by** the common factor. | This guarantees that when you multiply the outside factor back in, you recover the original expression. |\n\nThat\u2019s the whole process!
