No worries at all\u2014everyone starts somewhere, and I\u2019m here to walk you through it step by step.\u202fWriting algebraic expressions is just a way of turning a word problem or a situation into a short \u201cmath sentence\u201d using numbers, variables (like\u202f*x*\u202for\u202f*y*), and the usual operations (+,\u202f\u2013,\u202f\u00d7,\u202f\u00f7, exponents, etc.). \n\n**Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll tackle it together:**\n\n1. **Start with the language** \u2013 I\u2019ll show you how to spot the key pieces in a sentence (numbers, unknowns, actions like \u201cadd\u201d or \u201cmultiply\u201d).  \n2. **Pick a variable** \u2013 We\u2019ll decide what symbol to use for the unknown quantity.  \n3. **Translate the actions** \u2013 I\u2019ll map words like \u201csum,\u201d \u201cdifference,\u201d \u201cproduct,\u201d and \u201cquotient\u201d to the correct symbols.  \n4. **Put it all together** \u2013 You\u2019ll see how the pieces combine into a clean expression.  \n\nWe\u2019ll move at a pace that feels comfortable for you, and I\u2019ll check in after each step to make sure everything clicks.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Check \u2013 Let\u2019s Warm Up\n\nBefore we dive into a full example, I\u2019d like to gauge a little bit about the math you\u2019ve seen before. This will help me tailor the explanations just right for you.\n\n**Question:**  \nWhich of the following statements are you comfortable with? (You can pick any that apply, or let me know if none feel familiar.)\n\n1. Adding and subtracting numbers (e.g., 7\u202f+\u202f3, 12\u202f\u2013\u202f5).  \n2. Multiplying and dividing numbers (e.g., 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f6, 20\u202f\u00f7\u202f4).  \n3. Using letters to stand for numbers (like",
