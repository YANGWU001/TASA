That way I can tailor the explanations, examples, and practice just for you.\n\n---\n\n### First question:\n\n**When you think about a polygon (like a triangle, square, pentagon, etc.), what do you already know about the angles inside it or the angles formed outside it?**  \n\nYou can answer in any way that feels natural\u2014list what you remember, describe a picture you have in mind, or even share a quick example you\u2019ve seen before. If you\u2019re not sure about anything, that\u2019s completely fine\u2014just let me know what feels familiar and what feels new.\n\n---\n\n*Your answer will help me decide the best next step: whether we should start with the basic definitions, explore how interior angles add up, look at exterior angles, or jump straight into solving a problem you\u2019re curious about.*  \n\nTake your time, and feel free to ask me anything that\u2019s on your mind while you answer!",

Each time you reach a new vertex you make the exterior\u2011angle turn you just described. After you\u2019ve gone all the way around and returned to your starting point, you have turned **exactly once around a full circle**\u2014that\u2019s a total turn of \\(360^\\circ\\).\n\nNo matter how many sides the polygon has, or whether",

Let\u2019s sharpen that picture a bit:\n\n1. **What it is:** An exterior angle is the angle you form **outside** a polygon when you extend one side of the shape.  \n2. **How to see it:** Pick any vertex\u202f\\(V\\) of a triangle (or any polygon). Keep one side of the triangle fixed, and **extend the adjacent side straight out** past the vertex. The angle between the **extended line** and the **other side that stays inside** the shape is the exterior angle at \\(V\\).  \n3. **Why it matters:** In any triangle, the exterior angle at a vertex equals the sum of the two interior (non\u2011adjacent) angles. This property is a handy tool for solving many geometry problems.\n\nThink of the exterior angle as the \u201cextra\u201d turn you\u2019d make if you kept walking along the shape\u2019s edge and then stepped outside at a corner.\n\n---\n\n### Next step \u2013 a personalized check\n\nLet\u2019s make sure the idea is clear and give you a chance to apply it.\n\n**Question:**  \nConsider triangle\u202f\\(ABC\\) with interior angles \\(\\angle A = 45^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle B = 70^\\circ\\).  \n\n1. **Draw** (you can sketch on paper or imagine) the exterior angle at vertex\u202f\\(C\\) by extending side\u202f\\(BC\\) beyond \\(C\\).  \n2. **Calculate** the measure of that exterior angle.  \n\n*Hint:* Use the fact that the interior angles of a triangle add up to \\(180^\\circ\\), and remember the exterior\u2011angle\u2011equals\u2011sum\u2011of\u2011remote\u2011interiors rule.\n\nFeel free to describe how you\u2019re visualizing the extension, or let me know if you\u2019d like a step\u2011by\u2011step walkthrough.
