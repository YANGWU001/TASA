It tells us *when* something happens and *how long* it lasts.  \n2. **How we keep track of it** \u2013 In everyday life we use things like clocks, calendars, phones, or even the sunrise and sunset.  \n3. **Why it matters** \u2013 Time helps us plan, coordinate with others, and understand cause\u2011and\u2011effect (e.g., \u201cI ate breakfast *before* I went to school\u201d).\n\nSince you\u2019re comfortable with a guided approach, let\u2019s start with something you see every day: **the clock on your wall or phone**.
