That makes it a perfect playground for learning **type\u2011aware naming** (e.g., `user_age` vs. `age`) and **estimating** effort (because you can prototype fast). |\n| **Spreadsheet for tasks** | Spreadsheets are great for *manual estimation* (e.g., \u201chours\u201d, \u201cstory points\u201d). Think of them as a low\u2011code \u201cestimate board\u201d. Later we\u2019ll translate that into code\u2011friendly formats (JSON, CSV, or a tiny SQLite DB). |\n| **Unsure about \u201cformal data \u2026\u201d** | No worries! Formalizing data means giving it a **clear schema** (a \u201ctype definition\u201d) and a **consistent naming convention**. Once you have that, estimating effort becomes more predictable because you can reuse the same patterns. |\n\n---\n\n### Next step: Let\u2019s drill down a little\n\nTo tailor the lesson, I need a bit more detail about how you **name** things and **estimate** work.
