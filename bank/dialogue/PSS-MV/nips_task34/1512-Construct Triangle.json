Since you learn best by actually doing the steps yourself, let\u2019s jump right into a hands\u2011on activity.\n\n**Your first task:**  \n\nImagine you have a ruler, a compass, and a blank sheet of paper. Using only these tools, **construct a triangle with side lengths of 5\u202fcm, 7\u202fcm, and 8\u202fcm** (you don\u2019t need to draw the final triangle yet\u2014just think through the construction steps).\n\n**Question:**  \nWhat is the first step you would take with your compass and ruler to begin constructing this triangle? Feel free to describe the exact motions you\u2019d make (e.g., \u201cPlace the compass point at \u2026, open it to \u2026, draw \u2026\u201d).  \n\nOnce you\u2019ve written out that first step, we\u2019ll move on to the next one together. \ud83d\ude80",
