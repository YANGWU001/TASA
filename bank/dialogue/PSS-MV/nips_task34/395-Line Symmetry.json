If you draw a vertical line right down the middle and then gently fold the paper along that line, the left side will line up perfectly with the right side. That line is called a **line of symmetry** (or *mirror line*).\n\n> **Why this works:** Every point on one side of the line has a matching point the same distance on the other side.\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Everyday objects that have line symmetry  \n| Object | Where the line is |\n|--------|-------------------|\n| A butterfly (wings spread) | A vertical line through the body |\n| The capital letter **A** | A vertical line down the middle |\n| A perfectly drawn **square** | Four lines \u2013 one vertical, one horizontal, and two diagonals |\n| A **snowflake** (idealized) | Many lines, but each one works the same way |\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 How you can test it yourself (hands\u2011on)  \n1. **Grab a piece of paper** and draw any simple",
