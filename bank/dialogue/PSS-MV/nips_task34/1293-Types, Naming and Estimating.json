That adds extra code and potential bugs.  \n   - **Data validation:** With a string you\u2019d need an extra check to make sure the user actually typed a number followed by \u201ccm\u201d. A numeric type (e.g., `int` or `float`) can enforce \u201conly numbers\u201d automatically, and you can store the unit separately.\n\n3. **A common compromise:**  \n   - **Store the numeric part** (`172`) as an `int` (or `float` if you want decimals).  \n   - **Store the unit** (`\"cm\"`) either as a separate string field or as an enum (`enum Unit { CM, IN }`).  \n   This keeps the data **easy to compute** while still preserving the original",
