Do you think it\u2019s a prime number or a composite number? \n\n- If you think it\u2019s prime, can you explain **why** you reached that conclusion?  \n- If you think it\u2019s composite, can you try to break it down into factors (other than 1 and itself) and tell me what you find?\n\nFeel free to walk me through your thought process step\u2011by\u2011step\u2014no rush!

Many odd numbers (like 3,\u202f5,\u202f7,\u202f11,\u202f13,\u202f17,\u202f19,\u202f23,\u202f29,\u202f31\u2026) are actually **prime**\u2014they have *no* other divisor besides 1 and themselves.  \n- **The \u201cmost odd numbers have a factor\u201d intuition is close, but it\u2019s the *even* numbers that are guaranteed to have a factor (2).** For odds, we have to **check** whether any smaller odd number can divide them.\n\n### \ud83d\udcda A quick, visual way to test 29\nThink of the **square\u2011root rule**:  \nIf a number \\(n\\) has a factor larger than \\(\\sqrt{n}\\), the complementary factor must be smaller than \\(\\sqrt{n}\\). So to decide if 29 is prime, we only need to test divisors up to \\(\\lfloor\\sqrt{29}\\rfloor = 5\\).\n\n| Potential divisor | Does it divide 29? | Reason |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------|\n| 2 (even)          | No                | 29 is odd |\n| 3                 | No                | \\(2+9 = 11\\) \u2192 not a multiple of\u202f3 |\n| 5                 | No                | Does not end in 0 or 5 |\n\nSince none of the numbers **2,\u202f3,",

A *prime* number has *no* such divisor.  \n- **Odd vs. even isn\u2019t the deciding factor.** Both odd and even numbers can be prime (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11\u2026) or composite (e.g., 9, 15, 21, 25\u2026).  \n\nLet\u2019s make that distinction concrete with a short, guided activity.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Mini\u2011Exercise (personalized step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\n1. **Pick a small number** (under 30) that you haven\u2019t looked at yet.  \n2. **List all the whole\u2011number factors** you can think of, starting with 1 and the number itself.  \n3. **Ask yourself:** \u201cIs there any factor in the middle?\u201d  \n   - If **yes**, the number is **composite**.  \n   - If **no**, the number is **prime**.\n\n*Tip:* You only need to test divisors up to the square root of the number.
