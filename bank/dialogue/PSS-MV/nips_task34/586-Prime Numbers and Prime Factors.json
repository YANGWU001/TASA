Your answers will tell me exactly where we should spend more time.\n\n---\n\n#### Let\u2019s start with a tiny piece of the puzzle:\n\n**A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.**  \n\nIn other words, you can\u2019t split a prime into smaller whole\u2011number factors (except for 1\u202f\u00d7\u202fthe number itself).\n\n**Quick example:**  \n- 2 is prime because its only divisors are 1 and 2.  \n- 4 is **not** prime because it can be written as 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (so it has more than two divisors).\n\n---\n\n### Your Turn \u2013 A Mini\u2011Quiz\n\n> **Question:** Look at the numbers 5,\u202f9,\u202f11,\u202f15.  \n> Which of these are prime?  \n> (You can just list the ones you think are prime and, if you\u2019re unsure, say why.)\n\nAnswer in your own words\u2014no need for a perfect list right now.
