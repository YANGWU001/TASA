When you can point to something that folds onto itself, the concept clicks faster.\n\n3. **How we\u2019ll proceed:**  \n   - I\u2019ll give you a short list of common objects.  \n   - You pick the one that feels most familiar, or tell me if none feel right and we\u2019ll try a different approach.  \n   - From there we\u2019ll explore *why* that object has (or doesn\u2019t have) line symmetry, and then move on to drawing your own examples.\n\n---\n\n### Choose an Everyday Object (or tell me your thoughts)\n\nBelow are a few items that many people notice have a clear line of symmetry. **Pick the one that resonates most with you**, or let me know if you\u2019d rather think of something else entirely.\n\n1. **A butterfly** \u2013 the wings mirror each other when you draw a line down the middle of its body.  \n2. **A capital letter \u201cA\u201d** \u2013 the left and right sides match if you draw a vertical line through the middle.  \n3. **A snowflake** \u2013 each arm looks",

This is the formal definition of symmetry. |\n\n**A tiny nuance:** Most everyday coffee mugs have a handle, which *breaks* the perfect vertical symmetry. If you picture a plain cylindrical mug **without** a handle, the vertical line you drew is indeed an axis of symmetry.
