Let\u2019s break it down together, step by\u202f1, and make sure every piece clicks before you move on.\n\n1. **What the \u201cstraight arm\u201d means**  \n   - Imagine the compass as a tiny \u201cpair of legs.\u201d One leg is the **sharp\u2011pointed end** that stays fixed in the paper; the other leg holds the pencil. The leg with the pencil is the *moving* leg, and the leg with the sharp point is the *fixed* leg.  \n   - When I say \u201cput the ruler along the straight arm that holds the pencil,\u201d I\u2019m referring to that *pencil\u2011holding* leg. It\u2019s the longer, straight piece that you can line up with a ruler.\n\n2. **Why we line the ruler up**  \n   - The ruler gives you a reliable reference for measuring the **5\u202fcm radius** you need. By placing the ruler **against the side of the pencil\u2011holding arm**, you can slide the compass until the tip of the pencil is exactly 5\u202fcm from the fixed point.\n\n3. **A quick visual check**  \n   - Hold the compass so the pencil\u2011leg is pointing upward.  \n   - Take a ruler and place its edge **against the flat side of that leg** (the side you can actually see and feel).  \n   - Make sure the ruler\u2019s 0\u2011cm mark lines up with the tip of the pencil. Then, slide the compass until the point of the other leg (the sharp tip) lines up with the 5\u2011cm mark on the ruler. That\u2019s your radius.\n\n4. **Lock it in**  \n   - Once the distance looks right, gently squeeze",

You\u2019ve nailed the key idea: the **straight arm** of a drafting compass (sometimes called the \u201cruler arm\u201d) is the piece that has the scale bar or ruler attached to it. The other arm\u2014the one with the sharp point\u2014is the **pivot arm**, and it stays fixed in the centre of the figure you\u2019re measuring or drawing.\n\nWhen you line the ruler up, you\u2019re really using the straight arm as a reference edge. You slide the compass so that the point of the pivot arm sits exactly on the start point, then you rotate the whole tool until the straight arm\u2019s ruler aligns with the line (or edge) you want to copy or measure. This lets you transfer a precise distance without having to guess.\n\nA couple of quick checks to make sure the picture is clear:\n\n1. **Identify the parts** \u2013 Can you point out (or name) the straight arm, the pivot arm, the hinge, and the scale bar on a typical drafting compass?  \n2. **Describe the motion** \u2013 When you move the compass to copy a line, which arm stays stationary and which one moves?  \n3. **Explain the purpose** \u2013 Why is it helpful to have the ruler glued to the straight arm rather than holding a separate ruler?\n\nYou\u2019re doing exactly the right thing by asking questions and confirming each step.
