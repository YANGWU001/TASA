Let\u2019s take a breath and break the task into bite\u2011size pieces so it feels manageable again.\n\n1. **What\u2019s the goal?**  \n   You want to measure the angles on the bottle (or any object) accurately. To do that you first need a **reference line** \u2013 a straight edge you can trust as \u201czero degrees.\u201d\n\n2. **What\u2019s already in place?**  \n   You\u2019ve already thought about drawing that reference line, which is a fantastic first step.

Place the ruler flat against the surface of the bottle where you\u2019ll be measuring. That ruler becomes your reference line. Then, line up the protractor\u2019s baseline with the ruler and note where the bottle\u2019s edge crosses the protractor\u2019s scale. That crossing point is the angle you\u2019re after.\n\n5. **Check\u2011in**  \n   After you give it a quick try, notice:  \n   - Was the ruler easy to keep straight?  \n   - Did the",
