The *midpoint* is the **exact spot halfway between those two points**\u2014the place you\u2019d land if you walked the same distance from the first point as from the second point.  \n3. In a coordinate plane, \u201chalfway\u201d means that the **x\u2011coordinate** of the midpoint is the average of the two x\u2011values, and the **y\u2011coordinate** is the average of the two y\u2011values.\n\nSo, if the points are \\((x_1 , y_1)\\) and \\((x_2 , y_2)\\), the midpoint \\((M_x , M_y)\\) is  \n\n\\[\nM_x = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\qquad \nM_y = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf A quick, hands\u2011on check\n\nLet\u2019s try a tiny example together.

If you were to walk from\u202fA\u202fto\u202fB, the spot where you\u2019d be **exactly halfway** through the walk is called the **midpoint**. In other words, the midpoint is the point that splits the segment\u202fAB\u202finto two equal halves.\n\nA quick way to find that point when the coordinates are known is to **average the x\u2011coordinates and the y\u2011coordinates**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Midpoint } M = \\left( \\frac{x_A+x_B}{2},\\; \\frac{y_A+y_B}{2} \\right)\n\\]\n\nThink of it like",
