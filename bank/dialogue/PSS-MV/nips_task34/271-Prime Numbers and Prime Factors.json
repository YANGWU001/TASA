If you have 8 apples and you want to give them to 2 friends so that each friend gets the same number of apples, how many apples does each friend receive?\n\n2. **Step\u2011by\u2011step approach**  \n   - Start with the total amount: **8**.  \n   - Ask yourself: \u201cHow many times does **2** fit into **8**?\u201d  \n   - You can count it out: 2\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f4, 4\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f6, 6\u202f+\u202f2\u202f=\u202f8 \u2192 that\u2019s three times.  \n   - So **8 \u00f7 2 = 4**, not 3.\n\n3. **Why the answer is 4**  \n   If you actually give the 8 items to 2 groups, each group ends up with **4** items (8\u202f=\u202f4\u202f+\u202f4).
