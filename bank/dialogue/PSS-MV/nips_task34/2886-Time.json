What we really experience is **a mismatch between the clock\u2019s objective speed and our perception**\u2014the clock keeps ticking at the same rate, but our brain *interprets* the intervals differently.  \n\n**So you could say:**  \n> \u201cWhen I\u2019m bored, my internal sense of the clock\u2019s beats *slows down*, which makes the minutes feel like they\u2019re dragging.\u201d\n\nThat wording keeps the metaphor but aligns it with the science.\n\n---\n\n## Next step: Dive deeper into *why* this happens\n\nSince you thrive with personalized guidance, let\u2019s explore the underlying mechanisms together.
