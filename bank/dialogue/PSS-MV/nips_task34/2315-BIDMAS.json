Could you tell me:\n\n1. **What\u2019s your current comfort level with BIDMAS?**  \n   - *Very comfortable* \u2013 I just need a quick refresher.  \n   - *Somewhat comfortable* \u2013 I know the basics but sometimes get stuck.  \n   - *New to it* \u2013 I\u2019m not sure where to begin.\n\n2. **Which type of explanation helps you the most?**  \n   - A step\u2011by\u2011step written walk\u2011through.  \n   - Visual aids (like colour\u2011coded brackets or diagrams).  \n   - Real\u2011world examples that show why the order matters.  \n   - A mix of all three.\n\n3. **Let\u2019s try a quick warm\u2011up problem together.**  \n   Solve the following expression using BIDMAS, and feel free to write down (or describe) each step you take:\n\n   \\[\n   8 + 3 \\times (4 - 2)^2 \\; \\div \\; 6\n   \\]\n\n   *If you\u2019re not sure where to start, just tell me what you think the first thing to do might be, and we\u2019ll work through it together.*\n\n---\n\nYour answers will help me shape the rest of our tutoring session so it fits exactly how you learn best.
