This will help us see how you\u2019re visualizing the construction.",

Write \u201c5\u202fcm\u201d above point\u202fA and \u201c7\u202fcm\u201d above point\u202fB.  \n\n3. **Create the two circles**  \n   - With a compass set to **5\u202fcm**, place the point on **A** and draw a full circle. Color the interior pink.  \n   - Without changing the compass width, place the point on **B** and draw another circle. Color this one light\u2011green.  \n\n4. **Find the intersection** \u2013 The two circles will cross at two points. Pick the point **C** that is **above** the base AB (you can label it with a red dot). This point is the third vertex of the triangle.  \n\n5",
