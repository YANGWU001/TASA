I\u2019ll break everything into small, clear steps, give you plenty of examples, and check in often to make sure each idea clicks before we add the next one. If anything feels confusing, just let me know and we can revisit it together.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Overview \u2013 What \u201cordering\u201d means\nWhen we **order** numbers, we\u2019re simply arranging them from **smallest** to **largest** (or the reverse).  \nFor positive numbers this is straightforward:  \n\n`2  < 5  < 9`\u2003(small \u2192 big)\n\nNegative numbers work the same way, but because they\u2019re **to the left of zero on a number line**, the \u201cmore negative\u201d a number is, the **smaller** it is.\n\n**Key rule:**  \n> **The farther left you go on the number line, the smaller the number.**  \n> So, \\(-8\\) is smaller than \\(-3\\) because \\(-8\\) sits farther left.\n\n---\n\n### Why does this happen?\nThink of a debt:  \n- Owing **\\$3** (\u20113) is a smaller debt than owing **\\$8** (\u20118).  \n- The larger the absolute value (the \u201csize\u201d of the number without the sign), the **greater the debt**, so the **smaller** the overall value.\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s practice together\nI\u2019ll give you a tiny, concrete task.

So even though both numbers are negative, \u20113 is *closer* to zero, which makes it the larger one.\n\n### A quick \u201ccheck\u2011in\u201d for you\n\nLet\u2019s see if that picture sticks.
