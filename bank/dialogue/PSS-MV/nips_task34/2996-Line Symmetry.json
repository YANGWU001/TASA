Where could that line go so that the two halves might match each other?\n2. **Fold\u2011and\u2011match test:** Pretend you could fold the shape along that line. Would the two parts line up perfectly without any gaps or overlaps?\n3. **Check each side:** Look at the edges, angles, and lengths on both sides of the line you imagined. Are they exactly the same?\n4. **State your conclusion:** Does the shape have a line of symmetry? If yes, draw (or describe) the line you used.\n\n---\n\n**Please write out your reasoning for each step** (you can use words, sketches, or both).

That is exactly what a **mirror image** looks like, so you\u2019ve correctly identified a *candidate* line of symmetry.\n\nLet\u2019s make that observation even stronger by turning it into a clear, ordered argument. A line is a line of symmetry when **all three** of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n1. **Corresponding points are equally distant from the line.**  \n2. **Corresponding line segments are mirror images (they have the same length and are reflected across the line).**  \n3. **Corresponding angles are equal.**  \n\nYou\u2019ve already noticed (2) and (3) in your mental picture. The next step is to check (1) explicitly and then write down each condition in its own short sentence. Doing this will give you a complete, step\u2011by\u2011step proof that the line you chose really *is* a line of symmetry.\n\n---\n\n### Next question (step\u2011by\u2011step style)\n\n**Task:** Write a short, numbered list that shows how the vertical line you described satisfies each of the three symmetry",
