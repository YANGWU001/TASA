I remember it\u2019s something like rise over run, so you take the change in\u202fy divided by the change in\u202fx.  A positive slope\u2026 maybe that means the line goes up as you move to the right?  I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think that\u2019s right.\n\n2. **y = mx + b\u2026**  \nYeah, I\u2019ve seen that before.  For example, I think I solved something like\u202f`y = 2x + 3` once.  I guess you just plug in an\u202fx\u202fvalue and you get\u202fy, right?  Like if\u202fx = 1, then\u202fy = 2(1) + 3 = 5.
