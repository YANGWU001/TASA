Let\u2019s break the idea of a \u201cnegative slope\u201d into bite\u2011size pieces so you can build confidence one step at a time.\n\n1. **What a slope tells us** \u2013 The slope of a line measures how steep the line is and whether it rises or falls as you move from left to right.  \n2. **Positive vs. negative** \u2013 If the line goes **up** as you move right, the slope is **positive**. If the line goes **down**, the slope is **negative**.  \n3. **Why it matters** \u2013 The sign (plus or minus) tells you the *direction* of change, while the absolute value tells you *how fast* that change happens.\n\nThink of it like a hill:  \n- Walking up a hill \u2192 positive slope (you\u2019re gaining height).  \n- Walking down a hill \u2192 negative slope (you\u2019re losing height).\n\nNow that we have the big picture, let\u2019s get you to practice describing a line in your own words.
