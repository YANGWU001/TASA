This will let me tailor the explanation just for you.**\n\n**Question 1 \u2013 Your current picture of \u201cslope\u201d:**  \n\n> *In your own words, how would you describe what the slope of a line tells us?*  \n> *If you\u2019re comfortable, could you also give a simple example (maybe with a short equation) where you can tell if the slope is positive, negative, or zero?*  \n\nFeel free to write out any thoughts, sketches, or even a quick doodle\u2014you can describe it in words if drawing isn\u2019t handy.

It tells you how much the\u202f*y*\u202fvalue changes when you move over one unit in the\u202f*x*\u202fdirection.  So if the slope is big and positive, the line goes up quickly; if it\u2019s negative, the line goes down; and if it\u2019s zero, the line is flat.\n\nMaybe an example\u2026 like the equation\u202f*y = 2x + 3*.  Here the number in front of\u202f*x*\u202fis\u202f2, so I guess the slope is positive (the line goes upward).
