I\u2019m excited to work with you on figuring out how to tell which of two numbers is larger by using subtraction.**  \n\nBefore we dive into a problem, could you tell me a bit about how you like to think through math questions? For example:\n\n- Do you prefer to **visualize** the numbers (like drawing objects or using a number line)?  \n- Do you like to **talk through the steps out loud** or write them down?  \n- Would a **real\u2011world scenario** (like comparing the number of apples you have vs. a friend) help you see what\u2019s happening?\n\nOnce I know a little about what works best for you, we\u2019ll start with a simple \u201cwhich is bigger?\u201d question that uses subtraction.
