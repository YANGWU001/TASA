The next step is **comparing those totals** to decide which original \u201ccombined quantity\u201d is larger.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Why this works\nWhen we want to know which of two groups is bigger, adding the numbers in each group gives us a *single* value we can easily compare. Think of it like putting each group on a scale\u2014once the numbers are summed, the scale shows which side is heavier.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Feedback for you\n1. **Correct calculations** \u2013 both sums are spot\u2011on!  \n2. **Clear presentation** \u2013 you listed each equation on its own line, which makes it easy to read.  \n3. **Next step suggestion** \u2013 after you have the sums, explicitly state which one is larger (or if they\u2019re equal). That extra sentence seals the reasoning.\n\n**Example of a complete answer:**\n\n> \u201c7\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f12 and 6\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f14. Since 14\u202f>\u202f12, the second pair (6 and 9) represents the larger combined quantity.\u201d\n\nTry adding that concluding sentence yourself\u2014just a quick line will do!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc49 Your next personalized challenge\nNow let\u2019s stretch a little further while still keeping the process you\u2019re comfortable with.\n\n### Problem\nYou have three pairs of numbers.
