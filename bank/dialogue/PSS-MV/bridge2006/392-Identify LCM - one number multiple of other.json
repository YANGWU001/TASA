It\u2019s completely okay to feel stuck at the start \u2013 the LCM is a brand\u2011new idea, and the best way to learn it is by walking through each little step together.  \n\n1. **What \u201cLCM\u201d means** \u2013 the *least* (smallest) *common* (shared) *multiple* of two numbers. In other words, we\u2019re looking for the smallest number that both original numbers can \u201cfit into\u201d without leaving a remainder.  \n\n2. **How we usually find it** \u2013 a very visual, hands\u2011on way is to write out a short list of multiples for each number and then see where the lists first line up.  \n\n3. **Why that works** \u2013 every multiple of a number is just that number added to itself repeatedly (e.g., 3,\u202f6,\u202f9,\u202f12,\u2026). If a number shows up in *both* lists, it can be divided evenly by each original number. The first one that appears in *both* lists is the LCM.\n\nLet\u2019s try that together, step by step.
