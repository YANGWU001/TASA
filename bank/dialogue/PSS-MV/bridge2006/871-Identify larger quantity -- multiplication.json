Let\u2019s take a step back, break it down, and build the idea together.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Quick \u201cmini\u2011lesson\u201d \u2013 What does multiplication really mean?\n\n1. **Repeated addition** \u2013\u202fWhen we say *5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3*, we\u2019re really saying \u201cadd the number 5 together three times\u201d:  \n   5\u202f+\u202f5\u202f+\u202f5\u202f=\u202f15.  \n   So multiplication is just a faster way to add the same amount over and over.\n\n2. **Groups of the same size** \u2013\u202fIf you have *5 boxes* and each box holds *3 crayons*, you have **5 groups** of **3 crayons**. The total number of crayons is the product **5\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 = 15**.\n\n3. **Comparing two groups** \u2013\u202fTo see which collection is larger, we can compute the product for each and then compare the results.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Let\u2019s apply it to the original story\n\n- **Your side:** 5 boxes, each with the *same* number of crayons (let\u2019s call that unknown number **c**).  \n  Total crayons = **5\u202f\u00d7\u202fc**.\n\n- **Friend\u2019s side:** 12 boxes, each also with **c** crayons.  \n  Total crayons = **12\u202f\u00d7\u202fc**.\n\nBecause 12\u202f>\u202f5, **12\u202f\u00d7\u202fc** will always be larger than **5\u202f\u00d7\u202fc** (as long as c is a positive",
