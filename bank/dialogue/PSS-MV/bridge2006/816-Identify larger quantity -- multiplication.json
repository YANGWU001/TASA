Can you describe one example you\u2019ve encountered (or can imagine) and tell me how you would figure out the total number of items in all the groups together?\n\nYour answer will help me tailor the next steps just for you!

If you can picture a few groups of the same size, you\u2019ve already got the core idea.  \n4. **You\u2019ll get it** \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a simple example, then ask you to create *your own* one. That way you\u2019ll see the pattern and feel confident that you can do it yourself.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f First Guided Example (You can follow along)\n\n> **Imagine you have 3 small snack bags.**  \n> Each bag contains **4** raisins.  \n> How many raisins do you have in total?\n\n**How we solve it**  \n-",
