Your answer will help me tailor the next steps just for you! \ud83c\udf1f",

I had 3 packs of chips and each pack had 5 chips, so I thought 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 would give me the total number of chips. I wrote down 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5\u202f=\u202f15, and that seemed right, but then I got confused because I also counted the packs and thought maybe I should add 3\u202f+",
