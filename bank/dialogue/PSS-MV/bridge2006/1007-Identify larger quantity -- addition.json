When you\u2019re ready, let me know:\n\n1. **Your answer** (what is the sum, and is it larger than 70?)  \n2. **How you figured it out** (e.g., column addition, mental counting, using a number line, etc.)  \n\nYour response will help me tailor the next steps to match the strategies that work best for you.
