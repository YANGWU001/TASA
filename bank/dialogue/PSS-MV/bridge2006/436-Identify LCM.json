Once we have that meeting point, we can use it for adding fractions, finding common denominators, solving word problems, etc.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Let\u2019s Build the Idea Together\n\n1. **Pick two small numbers** (something like 3 and\u202f5, or 4 and\u202f6).  \n2. **Write the first few multiples** of each number in a simple list.  \n   - Example for 4: 4,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16,\u202f20,\u202f\u2026  \n   - Example for 6: 6,\u202f12,\u202f18,\u202f24,\u202f\u2026  \n3.",
