(e.g., 1\u202fcm, 2\u202fcm, 3\u202fcm, \u2026)\n3. **Count** \u2013 Once you decide on a possible piece length, divide 12\u202fcm by that length to see how many pieces fit.\n\nTake a moment to work through those steps, and then tell me:\n\n- **What length you think each piece might be**, and\n- **How many pieces that gives you**.\n\nIf you get stuck at any point, just let me know exactly where, and I\u2019ll give you a personalized hint. \ud83c\udf1f",

Since you mentioned you learn best with **personalized guidance**, I\u2019ll walk you through the idea slowly, check in with you after each little piece, and give you plenty of chances to ask questions or try something yourself.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccf What does a \u201chorizontal bar split into equal sections\u201d look like?\n\n1. **Picture a straight line** that goes left\u2011to\u2011right (like the top edge of a ruler).  \n2. **Now imagine little vertical marks** that cut that line into pieces that are all the same length.  \n3. Each piece between two marks is an **\u201cequal division.\u201d**  \n\nThink of a chocolate bar that\u2019s been snapped into identical squares\u2014that\u2019s the same idea, just drawn horizontally.\n\n**Quick Check:**  \nIf I told you the bar has **four** equal divisions, how many little \u201cgaps\u201d (the spaces between the marks) would you see?  \n\n*(Feel free to write your answer, or just say \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d and we\u2019ll explore it together.)*  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Why counting the gaps matters\n\nWhen a bar is divided into *n* equal sections, the number of **gaps** (the spaces between the marks) is always **n\u202f\u2013\u202f1**.  \n- Example: 3 sections \u2192 2 gaps, 5 sections \u2192 4 gaps, etc.\n\nUnderstanding that relationship will let you answer any \u201chow many divisions?\u201d question quickly.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Next personalized step",
