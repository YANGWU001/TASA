Subtracting is just asking, \u201cIf I take the left weight away from the right weight, do I end up with something left over (positive) or do I owe something (negative)?\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0e Let\u2019s try a concrete pair together  \n**Numbers:**\u202f**84** and **57**  \n\n**Step\u202f1:** Write the subtraction **both ways** (you don\u2019t have to decide which is bigger yet).  \n\n- 84\u202f\u2212\u202f57 =\u202f?  \n- 57\u202f\u2212\u202f84 =\u202f?\n\n**Step\u202f2:** Compute each result (you can use mental math or a quick scribble).  \n\n**Step\u202f3:** Look at the **sign** of each answer.  \n- Which one is positive?  \n- Which one is negative?\n\n",
