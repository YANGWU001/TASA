Could you answer these two short prompts for me?\n\n1. **A quick warm\u2011up problem:**  \n   *You have 4 baskets, and each basket holds 6 oranges. How many oranges do you have in total?*  \n   *(Feel free to write out the steps you\u2019d use to solve it.)*\n\n2. **Your learning preferences:**  \n   *When you\u2019re learning something new in math, what helps you the most?*  \n   - Seeing the numbers and steps written out step\u2011by\u2011step  \n   - Using pictures or objects (like drawing baskets, blocks, etc.)  \n   - Hearing an explanation out loud  \n   - Working through a similar example on your own first  \n   - Anything else that works for you?\n\nYour answers will let me tailor the next lesson exactly to the way you learn best.

We already have one piece (the 6\u202foranges).  \n\n**Can you look back at the original question and tell me**:\n\n- **Is there a statement about how many baskets there are in total?**  \n  *e.g., \u201cThere are three baskets\u2026\u201d*  \n- **Or does it mention a total number of oranges across all baskets?**  \n  *e.g., \u201cAltogether there are 20 oranges.\u201d*  \n\nEven a single word or number you spot will give us a new direction.\n\n---\n\n### Your Turn (Next Question)\n\n> **What other number or piece of information does the problem give you besides the 6 oranges?**  \n\nWrite down exactly what you see\u2014no need to solve anything yet. Just copy the phrase or number (e.g., \u201c4 baskets,\u201d \u201c15 oranges total,\u201d \u201cthe other basket has twice as many oranges,\u201d etc.).  \n\nOnce you share that, we\u2019ll stitch it together with the 6 oranges and move one step closer to the answer.  \n\nYou\u2019ve already proved you can locate the",
