If you \u201cbreak\u201d that line into two pieces, the two resulting angles are supplementary.  \n- The word *supplementary* comes from \u201csupplement,\u201d meaning *to add to*.\n\n**Why it matters:**  \n- In geometry problems you often need to find an unknown angle when you know its partner is supplementary.  \n- Many real\u2011world situations (e.g., the angles formed when two walls meet a floor) involve supplementary pairs.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Let\u2019s personalize the next step  \nSince you said you don\u2019t know anything yet, I\u2019ll guide you step\u2011by\u2011step.
