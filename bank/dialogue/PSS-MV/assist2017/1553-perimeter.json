If you lay the string flat against the edge of any shape (a rectangle, a triangle, even an irregular garden) and then pull it tight, the length of that string is the shape\u2019s perimeter.

Let\u2019s take it one tiny step at a time, and I\u2019ll be right here with you.\n\n1. **Picture it** \u2013 Imagine you have a small garden that\u2019s shaped like a rectangle. If you walked all the way around the edge, the distance you\u2019d cover is the *perimeter*.  \n2. **Break it into pieces** \u2013 A rectangle has four sides: two long sides (let\u2019s call them the *length*) and two short sides (the *width*). The total distance is just the sum of those four sides:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = \\text{length} + \\text{length} + \\text{width} + \\text{width}\n   \\]  \n   which we usually write as  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Try a concrete example** \u2013 Let\u2019s pick numbers you can easily picture. Suppose the length of the garden is **5\u202fm** and the width is **3\u202fm**. What would the perimeter be?  \n\n   *First, add the length and width:* 5\u202fm\u202f+\u202f3\u202fm\u202f=\u202f8\u202fm  \n   *Then double it (because there are two of each side):* 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202fm\u202f=\u202f16\u202fm  \n\n   So the perimeter would be **16\u202fmeters**.\n\nNow, you don\u2019t have",
