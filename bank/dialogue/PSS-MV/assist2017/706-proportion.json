It says **2\u202fcups of flour** makes **24\u202fcookies**.  \n> Write down the **ratio of flour to cookies** in the form \u201c_something_\u202f:\u202f_ something_.\u201d  \n\n*What is the ratio of flour to cookies in the original recipe?*  \n\n(Just write it as \u201c2\u202fcups\u202f:\u202f24\u202fcookies\u201d or simplify it if you\u2019d like",

That\u2019s exactly the relationship the recipe gives us, so you\u2019re on the right track.\n\nLet\u2019s look at that ratio a little more closely, one tiny step at a time:\n\n1. **What does a ratio tell us?**  \n   It tells us how many units of one quantity correspond to a certain number of units of another quantity.  \n   Here, **2\u202fcups of flour** are needed for **12\u202fcookies**.\n\n2. **Can we simplify the ratio?**  \n   Both numbers can be divided by the same factor (the greatest common divisor).  \n   - 2 \u00f7 2 =\u202f1  \n   - 12 \u00f7 2 =\u202f6  \n\n   So the simplified ratio is **1\u202fcup\u202f:\u202f6\u202fcookies**.  \n   This means **1\u202fcup of flour makes 6 cookies**.\n\n3. **Why might we want the simplified form?**  \n   It makes it easier to scale the recipe up or down. If you know the \u201cper\u2011cookie\u201d amount, you can quickly answer \u201cHow many cups for X cookies?\u201d without having to work with larger numbers each time.\n\nYou\u2019ve already nailed the first step\u2014identifying the original ratio. The next step is to use that ratio to find out how much flour you\u2019d need for a different number of cookies.\n\n---\n\n### Next Question (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\n**If you wanted to bake 24 cookies, how many cups of flour would you need?**\n\n*Hint:*  \n1. Start from the simplified ratio **1\u202fcup\u202f:\u202f6\u202fcookies**.  \n",
