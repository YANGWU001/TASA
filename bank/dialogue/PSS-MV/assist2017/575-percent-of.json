It\u2019s completely okay to feel stuck at the start \u2013 \u201cpercent\u201d is one of those ideas that clicks the moment we tie it to something concrete you already know. Let\u2019s take it one tiny step at a time:  \n\n1. **Connect to something familiar** \u2013 Think of a \u201cpercent\u201d as a slice of a pizza that\u2019s been cut into 100 equal pieces. If you have 25\u202f% of the pizza, you\u2019ve taken 25 of those 100 tiny slices.  \n\n2. **Use a real\u2011world picture** \u2013 Imagine you have a $100 bill. \u201c20\u202f% off\u201d means you subtract 20 of those 100 \u201cdollar\u2011units,\u201d leaving you with $80.  \n\n3. **Break the symbol down** \u2013 The \u201c%\u201d sign is just a shorthand for \u201cper\u202fhundred.\u201d So whenever you see 45\u202f%, read it as \u201c45 out of every 100.\u201d  \n\n4. **Try a tiny, hands\u2011on example** \u2013 Grab a handful of small objects (like beads, coins, or Lego bricks). Count out 10 of them and call that your \u201cwhole\u201d (100\u202f%). Then pick 3 of those 10 and see how that feels like \u201c30\u202f%.\u201d  \n\nBy turning the abstract symbol into something you can see and touch, the idea becomes a lot less fuzzy.  \n\n---\n\n### Next question (tailored to your need for step\u2011by\u2011step guidance)\n\n> **Imagine you have a jar with 50 marbles.
