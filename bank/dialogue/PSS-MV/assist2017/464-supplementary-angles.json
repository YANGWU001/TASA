Let\u2019s build the idea of supplementary angles together, step by step, and I\u2019ll check in with you along the way so you always know exactly what\u2019s happening.\n\n**What \u201csupplementary angles\u201d means**  \n1. **Angle basics** \u2013 An angle is the amount of turn between two rays that share a common endpoint (the vertex). We measure that turn in degrees (\u00b0).  \n2. **A \u201cpair\u201d of angles** \u2013 When we talk about \u201csupplementary angles,\u201d we are always talking about **two** angles that are considered together.  \n3. **The key rule** \u2013 The **sum** of the measures of those two angles is **exactly 180\u00b0**. In other words, if you add the number of degrees in the first angle to the number of degrees in the second angle, you get 180.\n\nWhy 180\u00b0? Think of a straight line. A straight line is a \u201cflat\u201d angle of 180\u00b0. If you split that straight line into two pieces, the two pieces are supplementary because together they still make the whole straight line.\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s try a tiny, guided exercise\n\n**Step\u202f1 \u2013 Visualize**  \nImagine a straight line drawn on a piece of paper.

Let\u2019s do exactly that, step by step, and I\u2019ll pause after each little piece so you can tell me if it clicks.\n\n1. **A straight line = 180\u00b0**  \n   Imagine a perfectly straight piece of wire. If you could \u201cunfold\u201d that wire into a half\u2011circle, it would sweep through **180 degrees**.  \n\n2. **Two angles that share a side**  \n   Pick any point on that line and draw a ray (a half\u2011line) upward from it. That ray creates **two adjacent angles** on the line: one on the left\u2011hand side of the ray and one on the right\u2011hand side.  \n\n3. **What makes them \u201csupplementary\u201d?**  \n   If you add the measures of those two angles together, you should get the full 180\u00b0 of the straight line.
