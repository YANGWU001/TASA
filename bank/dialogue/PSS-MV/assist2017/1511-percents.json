(Is it between 0\u202f% and 100\u202f%? Does it feel close to the original fraction?)*\n\n---\n\n**Your turn:** Write out each of the five steps above, filling in the actual numbers and operations you use. When you\u2019ve completed the steps, share your final answer (the percent) and a brief note on how you verified it.  \n\nIf you get stuck or think a step might be wrong, pause and revise before moving on\u2014that\u2019s part of the learning process! \ud83c\udf1f",
