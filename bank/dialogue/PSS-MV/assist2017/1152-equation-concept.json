Let\u2019s look closely at the original problem:\n\n\\[\n3x \\;+\\; 5 \\;=\\; 20\n\\]\n\n### Why we **subtract**\u202f5 (instead of adding it)\n\nThe goal is to get the term with\u202f\\(x\\)\u202falone on one side of the equation.  \nOn the left\u2011hand side we have **\\(3x + 5\\)**. The \u201c+\u202f5\u201d is *adding* 5 to the \\(3x\\) term.  \nTo **undo** that addition, we must do the opposite operation\u2014**subtraction**\u2014on *both* sides of the equation.  \n\nThink of it like a balance scale: whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other to keep it level.\n\nSo the correct first step is:\n\n\\[\n\\underbrace{(3x + 5)}_{\\text{left side}} \\;-\\; 5 \\;=\\; 20 \\;-\\; 5\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n\\[\n3x \\;=\\; 15\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Your next move\n\nNow that the \\(5\\) is gone, what should we do to isolate \\(x\\) itself?
