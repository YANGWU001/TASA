Imagine you have three sticks of lengths \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). If you try to join the ends of two sticks, they have to reach far enough to meet the third stick; otherwise you can\u2019t close the shape into a triangle.\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Write the three separate conditions\n\nIf the sides are \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), the rule actually gives **three** inequalities:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na + b &> c \\quad\\text{(the two shorter sides together must be longer than the longest side)}\\\\[4pt]\na + c &> b \\\\[4pt]\nb + c &> a\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nAll three must hold at the same time. If even one fails, the three lengths cannot form a triangle.\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Quick check with concrete numbers\n\nLet\u2019s test the rule with a simple set of numbers: \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = 5\\).\n\n1. \\(3 + 4 = 7 > 5\\)\u2003\u2713  \n2.",
