Let\u2019s start by getting a sense of where you\u2019re at with decimal multiplication so I can tailor our lessons just for you.\n\n**First question:**  \nWhen you think about multiplying two numbers that have decimals (for example, 2.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.4), what part of the process feels most confusing or unclear to you? Is it:\n\n- a) Keeping track of where the decimal points should go in the final answer,  \n- b) Setting up the multiplication (like arranging the numbers and aligning the digits),  \n- c) Understanding why the method works, or  \n- d) Something else entirely?\n\nFeel free to describe any specific example that\u2019s been tricky for you, too.
