That\u2019s what I remember.  \n\nWhy does that make sense geometrically?  I guess it\u2019s because you can make squares on each side of the triangle, and the area of the big square on the hypotenuse can be \u201cfilled\u201d by the two smaller squares on the legs.  Like you could cut the two smaller squares into pieces and rearrange them to exactly cover the big square.
