Let\u2019s fine\u2011tune the idea a little bit.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda What \u201csupplementary\u201d really means\n\n- **Supplementary angles** are two angles whose **measures add up to 180\u00b0** (a straight line).  \n- **Complementary angles** are two angles whose measures add up to **90\u00b0** (a right angle).\n\nSo the word *supplementary* comes from \u201csupplement\u201d \u2013 you\u2019re **supplementing** one angle with another to reach a straight line.\n\n**Why 180\u00b0?** Imagine a straight piece of paper. If you draw a line, then turn the paper until it\u2019s pointing the opposite direction, you\u2019ve turned **half a circle**, which is 180\u00b0.

Imagine a straight piece of paper. If you draw a line across it, the two \u201chalves\u201d of that line form a straight angle of 180\u00b0. When two smaller angles sit next to each other on that line, they \u201cfill up\u201d the straight angle together.  \n\n**So:**  \n- **30\u00b0 + 150\u00b0 = 180\u00b0** \u2192 the pair (30\u00b0,\u202f150\u00b0) is supplementary.  \n- **90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0** \u2192 two right angles are also supplementary.  \n\nIt\u2019s not about a right angle (90\u00b0) by itself; it\u2019s about the *sum* being a straight line.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 A quick visual check (you can try it on paper)  \n1. Draw a long horizontal line.  \n2. Pick a point on the line and use a protractor to draw an angle of, say, **45\u00b0** opening upward.  \n3. From the same point, draw another angle opening downward.  \n\nNow measure that second angle. What should it be so that the two together cover the whole straight line? (Hint: 180\u202f\u2013\u202f45 =\u202f135\u00b0.)  \n\nIf you try it, you\u2019ll see the two angles exactly line up to form the original straight line.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 How we\u2019ll move forward together  \nBecause you",
