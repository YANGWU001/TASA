Let\u2019s break the problem down into tiny, manageable pieces so you can see exactly what to do at each stage.\n\n1. **Recall the formula** \u2013 The perimeter\u202f\\(P\\) of a rectangle is the total distance around it.  \n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{length}) + 2 \\times (\\text{width})\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the numbers** \u2013 From the problem you have:  \n   - Length\u202f=\u202f5\u202fcm  \n   - Width\u202f=\u202f3\u202fcm  \n\n3. **Plug the numbers into the formula** \u2013 Replace \u201clength\u201d and \u201cwidth\u201d with the values you just identified.\n\n4. **Do the arithmetic one step at a time** \u2013 First multiply each side by\u202f2, then add the two results.\n\n5. **Write the final answer with the correct unit** \u2013 Perimeter is measured in centimeters (cm).\n\nIf you follow those five tiny steps, you\u2019ll get the answer without feeling overwhelmed. Try doing each step on a piece of paper or in your mind, and let me know what you get after step\u202f3. I\u2019ll check it with you before we move on to the next calculation.\n\n---\n\n### Next Question \u2013\u202fAnother Step\u2011by\u2011Step Practice\n\nNow that you\u2019ve seen how to handle a rectangle, let\u2019s practice the same process with a **different shape**.\n\n**Problem:**  \nA square has a side length of **7\u202fcm**.  \nUsing the same step\u2011by\u2011step approach, find the perimeter of the square.\n\n**What to do (outline for you):**  \n\n1. Write the perimeter formula for a square.  \n2. Identify the given measurement.  \n3. Substitute the number into the formula.  \n4. Perform the multiplication.  \n5.
