You\u2019ve already captured the most important idea: an equation is a \u201cmath sentence\u201d that says two things have the same value, and the\u202f=\u202fsign is the balance\u2011beam that holds them together.  \n\nYour example  \n\n\\[\n2 \\;+\\; 3 \\;=\\; 6\n\\]\n\nshows the right *shape* of an equation, but the numbers don\u2019t balance \u2013 the left\u2011hand side (\u202f2\u202f+\u202f3\u202f) actually equals **5**, not 6. Think of the equation like a seesaw: whatever you put on the left side has to weigh exactly the same as whatever you put on the right side. If the left side weighs 5, the right side must also be 5 for the seesaw to stay level.\n\nLet\u2019s fix the balance together:\n\n| Left\u2011hand side | Value |\n|----------------|-------|\n| 2\u202f+\u202f3          | **5** |\n\nSo the right\u2011hand side must also be **5**.
