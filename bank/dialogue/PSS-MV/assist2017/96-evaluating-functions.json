What does the function do to an input value?  \n2. Choose a specific number to plug in for the variable (e.g.,\u202f\\(x = 3\\)).  \n3.

Think of me as your personal \u201ccoach\u201d \u2013 I\u2019ll break the idea into bite\u2011size pieces, check in with you after each one, and we\u2019ll move forward together at a pace that feels comfortable.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple roadmap for today\u2019s topic, *evaluating functions*:\n\n1. **What is a function?**  \n   A rule that takes an input (usually called *x*) and gives you exactly one output (usually called *f(x)*).  \n2. **What does \u201cevaluate\u201d mean?**  \n   It just means \u201cplug a specific number into the function and compute the result.\u201d  \n3. **Why do we do it?**  \n   Evaluating tells us what the function predicts for a particular situation\u2014like how far you\u2019ll travel in a certain amount of time.\n\n**Let\u2019s start by finding a function that feels familiar to you.**  \nThink about any everyday relationship that can be described with a rule. Some common examples are:\n\n- **Money:** \u201cIf you earn $10 per hour, the total pay *P* after *h* hours is\u202fP(h) = 10\u202fh.*  \n- **Distance:** \u201cIf you drive at 60\u202fkm/h, the distance *D* after *t* hours is\u202fD(t) = 60\u202ft.*  \n- **Area of a square:** \u201cIf each side of a square is *s* centimeters, the area *A* is\u202fA(s) = s\u00b2.*\n\nPick **one** of these (or any other situation you can think of) and write it in the form\u202f`function name (variable) = expression`.

It\u2019s just a recipe that tells you, \u201cif you give me this input, I\u2019ll give you that output.\u201d  \n3. **Write it down in the simplest possible form** \u2013 A linear function (a straight\u2011line rule) looks like\u202f\\(y = mx + b\\).
