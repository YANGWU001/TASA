To make sure our sessions are perfectly suited to the way you learn best, could you tell me a bit about yourself?\n\n1. **What\u2019s your current experience with graphs?**  \n   - Have you worked with bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, etc., before?  \n   - Are there any particular types of graphs that feel confusing or intimidating right now?\n\n2. **How do you like to learn new material?**  \n   - Do you prefer step\u2011by\u2011step written explanations, visual walkthroughs with lots of examples, interactive practice problems, or a mix of these?  \n   - Would you find it helpful to start with real\u2011world data (like sports stats, climate data, or personal finance) that we can plot together?\n\n3. **What\u2019s a goal you have in mind for using graphs?**  \n   - For example, \u201cI want to understand the trends in my fitness data,\u201d or \u201cI need to interpret charts for a class project.\u201d  \n\nYour answers will help me tailor the lessons just for you\u2014whether that means walking through a single graph in detail, building a graph from scratch, or practicing a series of quick\u2011interpretation drills.
