Let\u2019s take a step back together and break the problem into tiny, manageable pieces.  \n\n1. **Recall the big picture** \u2013 You wanted to use a shopping example to practice percentages (discounts, tax, tip, etc.). Think of a single, concrete purchase you might make: a shirt, a bag of groceries, a coffee, anything you\u2019re comfortable visualizing.  \n\n2. **Identify the numbers you already have** \u2013  \n   - *Original price* (the price before anything changes)  \n   - *Percentage* you need to apply (e.g., \u201c20\u202f% off\u201d or \u201c8\u202f% sales tax\u201d)  \n\n3. **Ask yourself:** *What is the question I\u2019m trying to answer?*  \n   - \u201cWhat will I actually pay after the discount?\u201d  \n   - \u201cHow much tax will be added to the price?\u201d  \n   - \u201cWhat is the total cost including tax?\u201d  \n\n4. **Turn the question into a simple equation** \u2013 Once you know the two numbers (price and percent), the calculation is just:  \n\n\\[\n\\text{Result} = \\text{Price} \\times \\left(1 \\pm \\frac{\\text{Percent}}{100}\\right)\n\\]\n\n   (Use \u201c+\u201d for tax/tip, \u201c\u2013\u201d for a discount.)\n\nIf any of those steps feel fuzzy, let\u2019s focus on just **one** of them right now. Pick whichever feels most approachable to you\u2014maybe the original price of the item, or the percentage you want to work with. Write that number down, and we\u2019ll move forward together.\n\n---\n\n**Next Question (personalized for you)**  \n\n*Think of a specific",
