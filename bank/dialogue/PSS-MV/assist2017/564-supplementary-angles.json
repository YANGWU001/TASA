A straight line measures **180\u00b0**.  \n   - If you place two angles next to each other so that their outer sides line up along that straight line, the two angles together *fill* the whole line. That\u2019s why their measures add to **180\u00b0**.\n\n2. **Why subtraction helps**  \n   - If you know one angle, the other one is simply \u201cwhat\u2019s left\u201d to reach 180\u00b0.  \n   - Mathematically:\u202f**Other\u202f=\u202f180\u00b0\u202f\u2013\u202fKnown**.  \n\n3. **What might be tripping you up?**  \n   - Are you unsure about the subtraction step?  \n   - Do you get confused when the angle you\u2019re given is larger than 90\u00b0?  \n   - Is the idea of \u201ctwo angles that sit on a straight line\u201d fuzzy?\n\nLet me know which part feels fuzzy, and I\u2019ll give you a focused mini\u2011example right then.\n\n---\n\n### Next Practice Question (personalized for you)\n\n> **Problem:** One of a pair of supplementary angles measures **\\(x\\) degrees**.
