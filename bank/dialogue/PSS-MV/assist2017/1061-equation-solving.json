It\u2019s still solvable, but we\u2019ve introduced extra fractions that we didn\u2019t need to deal with yet.  \n\n**A smoother path** is to first **undo the addition** (the `+\u202f5`) and then tackle the multiplication by\u202f`3`. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Eliminate the constant term first** \u2013 subtract `5` from both sides.  \n2. **Then** you\u2019ll have `3x = 15`, which is a clean multiple of `x`.  \n3. Finally, divide by `3` to isolate `x`.\n\nThat sequence keeps the numbers whole and avoids fractions until the very last step.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Let\u2019s Walk Through the Preferred Steps Together\n\n1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**  \n   \\[\n   3x + 5 - 5 = ",
