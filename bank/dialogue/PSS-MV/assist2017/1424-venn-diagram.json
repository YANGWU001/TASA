I\u2019ve seen them in school when we talked about \u201csets\u201d and maybe in a math book about probabilities. I guess the circles are the \u201csymbols\u201d \u2013 sometimes they use rectangles or ovals, but mostly circles, right? I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any special notation beyond the circles themselves.\n\n2.",
