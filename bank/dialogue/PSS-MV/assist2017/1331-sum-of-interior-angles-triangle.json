Let\u2019s tidy up a few details and then we\u2019ll practice a little together.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 What you already know (and where we can firm it up)\n\n| Your idea | How it fits the math |\n|-----------|----------------------|\n| *\u201cThe interior angles add up to about 180\u00b0.\u201d* | **Exactly right!** This is true for **every** triangle\u2014whether it\u2019s right\u2011angled, acute, obtuse, scalene or equilateral. |\n| *\u201cMaybe the formula is\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f90 = 180.\u201d* | That\u2019s a useful shortcut for a right\u2011angled triangle (since a right angle is 90\u00b0), but the *reason* the sum is always 180\u00b0 comes from a more general geometric fact, not just from multiplying 90\u00b0 twice. |\n| *\u201cDo the angles have to be equal?\u201d* | No. Only **equilateral** triangles have three equal interior angles (each 60\u00b0). Any triangle can have three different angle measures as long as they total 180\u00b0. |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd0 Why *all* triangles sum to 180\u00b0\n\nThink of a triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\). If you extend one side (say, side\u202fBC) and draw a line through the opposite vertex\u202fA that is **parallel** to the base BC, you create a straight line that \u201ccaptures\u201d the two exterior angles at A. Because parallel lines create **alternate interior angles**, those two exterior angles are exactly the interior angles at B and C.  \n\nA straight",
