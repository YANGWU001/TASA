For each one, write down:\n\n1. The number itself.  \n2. Its reciprocal (write it as a fraction or a decimal).  \n3. Verify the result by multiplying the number and its reciprocal\u2014does the product equal\u202f1?\n\nYou can write your answers in a simple list, like:\n\n- Number: \u2026\u2003Reciprocal: \u2026\u2003Product: \u2026\n\n---\n\n### What to think about while you work\n\n- **If the number is a fraction**, flipping it means swapping numerator and denominator.  \n- **",
