If you take **one\u2011hundredth** of each unit, you\u2019d have 0.01\u202f\u00d7\u202f50\u202f=\u202f0.5.  \n   Since 20\u202f% is 20 of those hundredths, you just do 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.01\u202f\u00d7\u202f50, which simplifies to 0.20\u202f\u00d7\u202f50.\n\n---\n\n### Let\u2019s try it together\n\n**Step\u202f1:** Write the percent as a decimal.  \n**Step\u202f2:** Multiply that decimal by the number you\u2019re finding the percent of.\n\n**Your turn:**  \n\n> **Question 1:** Write 35\u202f% as a decimal.  \n\nTake a moment, and when you\u2019re ready, tell me the decimal you get (you can also show how you arrived at it).

Let\u2019s break it down together:\n\n1. **What \u201cpercent\u2011of\u201d really means**  \n   - \u201cPercent\u201d just means \u201cout of 100.\u201d So \u201c25\u202f% of a number\u201d is the same as \u201c25 out of every 100 parts of that number.\u201d  \n   - In math language, we write this as:  \n     \\[\n     \\text{percent\u2011of} = \\frac{\\text{percent}}{100} \\times \\text{the whole quantity}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Turn the percent into a fraction (or a decimal)**  \n   - Take the percent you\u2019re given and put it over 100.  \n   - Example: 40\u202f% \u2192 \\(\\frac{40}{100}\\).  \n   - You can also simplify that fraction (40/100 = 4/10) or change it to a decimal (0.40).  \n\n3. **Multiply by the number you\u2019re interested in**  \n   - Once you have the fraction/decimal, multiply it by the \u201cwhole\u201d number.  \n   - Example: \u201cWhat is 40\u202f% of 50?\u201d \u2192 \\(0.40 \\times 50 = 20\\).  \n\n4. **Check your work with a quick sanity test**  \n   - Does the answer seem reasonable? 40\u202f% is a little less than half, so the result should be a little less than half of 50",
