Let\u2019s break it down together, step by step, and keep the focus on *what you need to know right now*.\n\n1. **What \u201cadjacent\u201d really means** \u2013 Imagine two puzzle pieces that share a side. In geometry, two angles are *adjacent* when they sit next to each other, share a common vertex **and** share one side (the \u201carm\u201d of the angle). They don\u2019t overlap; they just touch.\n\n2. **Why some adjacent angles add to\u202f180\u00b0** \u2013 When a transversal cuts two parallel lines, each pair of adjacent interior angles (the ones inside the two parallel lines) are called *consecutive interior angles*. Because the parallel lines never meet, the shape they form is a straight line, and a straight line measures\u202f180\u00b0. That\u2019s why those two angles are *supplementary* (their measures sum to\u202f180\u00b0).\n\n3. **Complementary vs. supplementary** \u2013  \n   - *Complementary*: two angles that together make **90\u00b0** (think of the corner of a rectangle).  \n   - *Supplementary*: two angles that together make **180\u00b0** (think of a straight line).  \n\n   The terms describe the *relationship* between the measures, not the position of the angles. So you can have adjacent angles that are supplementary, but you can also have non\u2011adjacent angles that are supplementary (e.g., opposite angles in a linear pair).\n\n4. **A quick visual",

Let\u2019s untangle the two pieces that are tripping you up:\n\n1. **Adjacency** \u2013\u202fTwo angles are *adjacent* when they share **both** a vertex **and** one of their sides. Think of a \u201cV\u201d shape: the two angles inside the V meet at the point of the V (the shared vertex) and they also share the line that makes up one arm of the V (the shared side). The other sides of the two angles point in different directions, so the angles sit right next to each other without overlapping.\n\n2. **Supplementary vs. Complementary**  \n   * **Supplementary** angles add up to **180\u00b0**. If you were to \u201cstraighten\u201d the two adjacent angles, they would form a straight line.  \n   * **Complementary** angles add up to **90\u00b0**.

The two segments form a corner that looks like the letter\u202fV.  \n   - The point\u202fO is the **vertex** (the common corner).  \n   - The two arms of the V are the **sides** (or \u201crays\u201d) of the angles.\n\n2. **Adjacency** \u2013 The two angles you just drew are **adjacent** because:  \n   - They share the same vertex\u202fO, **and**  \n   - They share one side (the arm that\u2019s common to both). The other sides are different, so the angles sit right next to each other without overlapping.
