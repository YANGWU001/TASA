A transversal is just another line that *also* meets those lines, but at a different spot.\n\nYou said, \u201cUm\u2026 I think when two\u2026\u201d.

You\u2019ve captured the idea that a transversal is a line that interacts with two (or more) other lines and that angles are created at the points of intersection. That\u2019s exactly the right starting point.  \n\nA couple of small tweaks will make your definition crystal\u2011clear:\n\n1. **\u201cRuns alongside\u201d \u2192 \u201ccuts across.\u201d**  \n   A transversal *crosses* the two (or more) lines, intersecting each of them at a single point. Because it actually *cuts* the lines, we get pairs of angles on each side of the intersection.\n\n2. **Angles \u201cwhere they meet.\u201d**  \n   At each intersection you get **four** angles (two acute, two obtuse, or sometimes right angles). These angles are the building blocks for the special relationships you\u2019ll soon learn (corresponding, alternate interior, etc.).\n\n**Why this matters:**  \nUnderstanding the exact geometry helps you see patterns\u2014like which angles are equal or supplementary\u2014without having to memorize a long list of rules. When you picture the transversal *cutting* the lines, you can instantly locate the angle pairs you need.\n\n---\n\n### Next Step \u2013\u202fYour Turn to Build the Picture\n\n**Task:** Draw a quick sketch (you can do it on paper or in a drawing app) of two parallel lines and a transversal that cuts across them.
