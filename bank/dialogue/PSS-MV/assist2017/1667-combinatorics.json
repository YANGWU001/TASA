Since you like personalized guidance, let\u2019s start by getting a quick sense of where you\u2019re at and what feels most comfortable for you.\n\n**First, a short, open\u2011ended question:**\n\n> *Can you tell me about any combinatorics topics you\u2019ve already encountered (e.g., counting principles, permutations, combinations, the pigeonhole principle, etc.)? If you haven\u2019t studied any yet, just let me know what kind of examples or real\u2011world situations you enjoy thinking about (like arranging books on a shelf, forming teams, or planning schedules).*\n\nFeel free to describe what you know, what you\u2019re curious about, or even a small problem you\u2019ve seen that sparked your interest.
