So \\(\\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{60}{100} = 60\\%\\).\n\n4. **Why this matters** \u2013 Converting between fractions, decimals, and percents lets you compare quantities that are expressed in different ways (e.g., a sale price of 30\u202f% off, a test score of \\(\\frac{18}{20}\\), or a probability of 0.75).\n\n---\n\n### Your Turn \u2013 A Personalized Prompt\n\nLet\u2019s practice the conversion together, step by step.\n\n**Question:**  \nYou earned \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\) of the points possible",
