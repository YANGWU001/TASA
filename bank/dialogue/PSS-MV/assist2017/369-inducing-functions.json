Could you let me know which of the following approaches feels most natural to you?\n\n| Learning Preference | What It Looks Like |\n|---------------------|--------------------|\n| **Visual/Diagrammatic** | You like pictures, flowcharts, or visual analogies that map concepts step\u2011by\u2011step. |\n| **Concrete Examples** | You prefer working through specific problems or real\u2011world scenarios first, then extracting the underlying ideas. |\n| **Conceptual/Big\u2011Picture** | You enjoy a high\u2011level overview, definitions, and how the idea fits into the broader mathematical landscape. |\n| **Hands\u2011On/Interactive** | You learn best by actively doing\u2014solving exercises, tweaking parameters, or exploring with a computer algebra system. |\n| **Narrative/Storytelling** | You like stories, historical context, or a \u201cstory of discovery\u201d that ties the math to a memorable narrative. |\n\n**Could you pick the style (or combination) that resonates most with you?**  \n\nOnce I know that, I\u2019ll pose our first content question about inducing functions in a way that matches your preference.
