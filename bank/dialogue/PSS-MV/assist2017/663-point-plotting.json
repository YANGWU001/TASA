Any point on the plane is written as an ordered pair **(x,\u202fy)**:\n   - The first number tells you how far to move **right** (positive) or **left** (negative) along the x\u2011axis.  \n   - The second number tells you how far to move **up** (positive) or **down** (negative) along the y\u2011axis.\n\nThink of the plane like a city map: the x\u2011axis is \u201ceast\u2011west streets,\u201d the y\u2011axis is \u201cnorth\u2011south avenues,\u201d and (x,\u202fy)",
