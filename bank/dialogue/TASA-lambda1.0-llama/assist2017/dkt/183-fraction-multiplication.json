    "content": "Let's break down the multiplication of 1 3/8 and 2 5/6 step by step.\n\nTo multiply these two mixed numbers, we first need to convert them into improper fractions. \n\nTo convert 1 3/8 into an improper fraction, we follow the same process as before. We multiply the whole number part (1) by the denominator (8), which gives 8, and then add the numerator (3), resulting in 11. So, the improper fraction for 1 3/8 is 11/8.\n\nTo convert 2 5/6 into an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number part (2) by the denominator (6), giving us 12, and then add the numerator (5), resulting in 17. So, the improper fraction for 2 5/6 is 17/6.\n\nNow that we have both mixed numbers converted to improper fractions, we can multiply them together. We have 11/8 and 17/6. To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (11 and 17) to get 187, and multiply the denominators (8 and 6) to get 48. So, the product of the fractions 11/8 and 17/6 is 187/48.\n\nThis fraction can be simplified further. We can check if 187 and 48 have any common factors. In this case, they don't have any common factors other than 1, so the fraction 187/48 is already in its simplest form.\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed 187/48. However, your initial answer was close, but not quite there.\n\nLet's try another question to practice your fraction-multiplication skills. Are you ready?\n\nHere's the next question:\n\nWhat is 3 2/5 \u00d7 5 1/4?",

So, the improper fraction for 3 2/5 is 17/5.\n\nTo convert 5 1/4 into an improper fraction, we multiply the whole number part (5) by the denominator (4), giving us 20, and then add the numerator (1), resulting in 21. So, the improper fraction for 5 1/4 is 21/4.\n\nNow that we have both mixed numbers converted to improper fractions, we can multiply them together. We have 17/5 and 21/4. To multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (17 and 21) to get 357, and multiply the denominators (5 and 4) to get 20. So, the product of the fractions 17/5 and 21/4 is 357/20.\n\nThis fraction can be simplified further. We can check if 357 and 20 have any common factors. In this case, they don't have any common factors other than 1 and 1, but 1 is not a factor for simplification in this case.
