    "content": "**Explanation:**\nYou're close, but let's break down the problem together. The bakery sells 25% more loaves of bread than they did last year. This means that the current number of loaves sold (480) is 125% of the number of loaves sold last year (100% + 25% more). To find the number of loaves sold last year, we need to divide the current number of loaves (480) by 1.25 (which is the same as 125%).\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\n\n480 \u00f7 1.25 = 384\n\nThis means that the bakery sold 384 loaves of bread last year.\n\nYou were on the right track by thinking about adding 25% more, but the key here is to understand that the current number of loaves is already the result of adding 25% more to the original amount. To find the original amount, we need to divide by 1.25.\n\n**Next Question:**\nLet's move on to the next question:\n\nQuestion: A shirt is on sale for 15% off the original price of $25. How much will you pay for the shirt after the discount?\n\nTake your time, and think about how you can apply what we've learned so far.",
