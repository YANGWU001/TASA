What is the original price of the shirt?\n\n**Answer choices:**\n\nA) $30\nB) $29.17\nC) $31.43\nD) $32\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1.  It starts with a concrete scenario that is easy to understand.\n2.  It requires the student to apply the concept of discount to a real-world situation.\n3.  The discount amount is moderate (15%), making it challenging but not too difficult.\n4.  The answer choices are reasonable and allow the student to apply the discount calculation.\n\nThis question will help the student practice calculating the original price using the discount concept and lay the groundwork for future practice questions that can gradually increase in difficulty and complexity.",

    "content": "Let's break down the problem together.\n\nThe shirt is on sale for $25, which is 15% off the original price. To find the original price, we need to add the discount back to the sale price. \n\nSince the discount is 15% of the original price, we can set up an equation:\n\nOriginal price - 15% of original price = $25\n\nWe can represent the original price as 'x'. Then, 15% of the original price is 0.15x. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nx - 0.15x = $25\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n0.85x = $25\n\nNow, we need to solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.85:\n\nx = $25 / 0.85\nx = $29.41\n\nSo, the original price of the shirt is approximately $29.41. \n\nYou chose B) $29.17, which is close but not quite correct. The correct answer is not among the options, but we can use this as an opportunity to learn and improve. \n\nLet's try another question that will help you practice calculating discounts and build on the concept.\n\n**Question:** \n\nA book is on sale for $18, which is 20% off the original price.

    "content": "**Explanation:**\n\nYou're on the right track, but let's refine your approach. When you said the sale price is 80% of the original price, that's a great insight. To find the original price, you need to divide the sale price by 0.8, which is the decimal equivalent of 80%.\n\nYour calculation is correct: $18 \u00f7 0.8 = $22.50. However, you mentioned uncertainty about the decimal, which is understandable. To avoid any confusion, let's focus on using decimals precisely.\n\nIn this case, you can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 20% = 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.20. Then, to find the original price, you can divide the sale price by (1 - 0.20), which is the same as 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is:\n\n$18 \u00f7 0.80 = $22.50\n\nYour answer, **A) $22.50**, is indeed the correct choice. Well done! You're making progress in understanding the concept of discounts.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question:**\n\nA toy is originally priced at $40, but it's on sale for $32.
