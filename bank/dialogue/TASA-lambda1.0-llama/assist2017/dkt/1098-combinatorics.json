    "content": "Student, let's break down the problem together.\n\nThe problem is asking for the number of different ways to arrange 3 books on the top shelf of a 5-shelf bookcase. This is a permutation problem because the order of the books matters. For example, if we arrange the books in the order A-B-C, it's different from the arrangement B-A-C.\n\nTo find the number of ways to arrange the 3 books, we can use the concept of permutations. The formula for permutations of n items taken r at a time is given by:\n\nnPr = n! / (n-r)!\n\nIn this case, we have n = 3 (the number of books) and r = 3 (the number of books we're arranging). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n3P3 = 3! / (3-3)!\n= 3! / 0!\n= 3! / 1\n= (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) / 1\n= 6\n\nSo, there are actually 6 different ways to arrange the 3 books on the top shelf. The correct answer is B) 6.\n\nLet's try another question to practice your understanding of combinatorics. Here it is:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA pizza parlor has 8 different toppings to choose from.
