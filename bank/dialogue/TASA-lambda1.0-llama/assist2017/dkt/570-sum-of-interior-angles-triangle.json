The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is actually 180\u00b0, not 360\u00b0. \n\nThink about it this way: a triangle has three angles, and when you add them up, you should get a total of 180\u00b0. In your case, you have two angles that are 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, and you're trying to find the third angle, x\u00b0. \n\nTo find x\u00b0, you can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180\u00b0. So, you can write an equation:\n\n30\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + x\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n\nTo solve for x\u00b0, you can simplify the equation:\n\n90\u00b0 + x\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n\nNow, subtract 90\u00b0 from both sides:\n\nx\u00b0 = 90\u00b0\n\nSo, the value of x\u00b0 is 90\u00b0. And since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0, the correct answer is indeed A) 180\u00b0.\n\nDon't worry if you got it wrong, it's all part of the learning process! You're getting closer to mastering the concept.

However, you're adding the third angle, 90\u00b0, to that sum, which gives you 180\u00b0. But, since we already know that the sum of the first two angles is 90\u00b0, we should be adding the third angle to 90\u00b0, not to the sum of the first two angles.\n\nSo, let's try again:\n\n30\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 90\u00b0\n90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n\nThe correct answer is indeed 180\u00b0.
