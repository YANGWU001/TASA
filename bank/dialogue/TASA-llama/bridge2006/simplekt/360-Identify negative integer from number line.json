This is the third consecutive question where you've placed a positive number to the right of a negative number on the number line. Although you correctly identified that -3 is a negative number and should be placed to the left of 0, you again mistakenly placed a positive number (0) to the right of -3. Remember, on the number line, negative numbers are to the left of zero, and positive numbers are to the right of zero. Since -3 is to the left of 0, the correct placement of numbers on the number line indicates that the positive number should be to the right of 0, not immediately to the right of -3. In this case, the correct answer is actually **D) 6**, as it is the positive number that appears to the right of 0 on the number line.\n\n**Why is the correct answer 6?** The number line representation [-6 | -2 | 0 | 2 | 6] shows that -3 is placed to the left of 0, and 6 is the positive number to the right of 0. This indicates that 6 should be the correct answer.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build your confidence with negative integers on a number line.
