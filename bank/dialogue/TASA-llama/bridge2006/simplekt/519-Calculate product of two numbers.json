The answer choices are spaced evenly apart, making it a multiple-choice question that requires the student to recall the correct product.\n\n**Difficulty Level:** Moderate, as it builds upon the student's existing knowledge of multiplication facts, but with a relatively simple multiplication problem.\n\n**Why this question?** This question is a good starting point for the student because:\n\n1. It's a straightforward multiplication problem that aligns with their current knowledge level.\n2. It requires recall of a basic multiplication fact, which is a fundamental concept in calculating the product of two numbers.\n3. The answer choices are reasonable and don't require complex calculations or problem-solving.\n\n**Next Steps:** If the student answers this question correctly, I would provide feedback and gradually increase the difficulty level of the questions to challenge them further. If they struggle with this question, I would provide additional guidance and support to help them build a stronger foundation in calculating the product of two numbers.",
