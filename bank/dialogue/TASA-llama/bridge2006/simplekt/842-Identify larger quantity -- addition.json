They demonstrated a good understanding of the concept that adding zero doesn't change the total number of items. Their reasoning, \"When I add a group of five objects and then add nothing more, I guess the total stays at zero because there's 'nothing' added,\" shows that they're thinking about the physical act of adding objects together and understanding the concept of zero as a neutral value.
