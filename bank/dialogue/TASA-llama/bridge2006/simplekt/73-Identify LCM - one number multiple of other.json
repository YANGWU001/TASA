What is the smallest multiple of 3 that both 6 and 9 can divide into evenly?\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1.  Build on their existing knowledge of multiples: The student already knows that 6 and 9 are multiples of 3, so this question reinforces that understanding.\n2.  Target their area of struggle: The question requires the student to identify the LCM when one number is a multiple of the other, which is the specific concept they're struggling with.\n3.  Assess their current understanding: By asking the student to find the LCM, we can gauge their ability to apply their knowledge and identify any areas where they may need further practice or review.\n\nThis question is likely to be answerable by the student, and it will help us assess their current understanding and identify areas for improvement.",

You correctly identified that 6 is a multiple of 3 and 9 is also a multiple of 3, and then you found the smallest multiple of 3 that both numbers can divide into evenly, which is 12.

In this case, since 8 goes into 16, and 16 is a multiple of 8, the correct LCM of 8 and 16 is actually 16.

It targets their area of struggle: The question requires the student to identify the LCM when one number is a multiple of the other, which is the specific concept they're still working on.\n3.  It assesses their current understanding: By asking the student to find the LCM, we can gauge their ability to apply their knowledge and identify any areas where they may need further practice or review.\n\nThis question is similar to the previous ones, but with a slightly different pair of numbers. It should help us see if you can consistently apply the concept of LCM when one number is a multiple of the other.\n\nThis question is designed to help you build on your understanding of LCM and develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between numbers.",
