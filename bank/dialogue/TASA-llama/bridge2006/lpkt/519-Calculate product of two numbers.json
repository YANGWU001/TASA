They correctly broke down the multiplication problem by considering the tens place, recognizing that 40 can be broken down into 4 tens and a zero, and then multiplied by 9. Their calculation of 4 * 9 = 36 and adding a zero at the end is a good approximation, but they correctly concluded that the product is indeed 360. However, they also considered the possibility of 370, which is not correct. To further reinforce their understanding, let's break it down accurately: 40 * 9 = (40 * 10) + (40 * -1) = 400 - 40 = 360.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help the student build on their understanding of calculating the product of two numbers, let's try a question that involves multiplying two two-digit numbers with a specific pattern.
