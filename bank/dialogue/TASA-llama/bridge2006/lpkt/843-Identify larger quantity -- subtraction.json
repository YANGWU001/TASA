When we subtract 5 from 18, we're essentially finding the difference between the two numbers. Think of it like taking away 5 items from a group of 18 items. In this case, 18 - 5 would be 13, but then we need to think about what the question is asking, \"Identify larger quantity -- subtraction,\" which means we need to identify the larger number between 5 and 18.
