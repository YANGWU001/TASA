Given their struggles with identifying LCM when one number is a multiple of the other, the question will focus on a basic scenario where one number is a multiple of the other.\n\nHere's the practice question:\n\n**Question:** Find the LCM of 6 and 18.\n\n**Explanation:** We know that 18 is a multiple of 6, since 18 \u00f7 6 = 3. This means that 6 is a factor of 18. To find the LCM, we need to find the smallest multiple that both numbers have in common. Since 6 is a factor of 18, the LCM will be 18.\n\n**Multiple Choice Options:**\n\nA) 3\nB) 6\nC) 18\nD) 24\n\nThis question is designed to help the student:\n\n1. Recognize that when one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is the larger number.\n2. Apply this concept to a simple scenario.\n3. Build confidence in identifying LCM when one number is a multiple of the other.\n\nBy answering this question correctly, the student will demonstrate their understanding of the concept and build a strong foundation for further practice and learning.",

The student showed a tendency to mistakenly choose the smaller number as the LCM, which is a concept they previously struggled with. In this case, 18 is a multiple of 9, and therefore the LCM is 18. This mistake suggests that the student needs more practice and reinforcement to solidify their understanding of this concept.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nHere's a new practice question that's tailored to the student's current knowledge state:\n\n**Question:** Find the LCM of 12 and 24.\n\n**Explanation:** We know that 24 is a multiple of 12, since 24 \u00f7 12 = 2. This means that 12 is a factor of 24. To find the LCM, we need to find the smallest multiple that both numbers have in common. Since 12 is a factor of 24, the LCM will be 24.\n\n**Multiple Choice Options:**\n\nA) 12\nB) 18\nC) 20\nD) 24\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1. Reinforce the concept that when one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is the larger number.\n2. Encourage the student to apply this concept to a new scenario.\n3.
