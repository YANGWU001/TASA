Here's the first practice question:\n\n**Question:** Which number is larger: 45 + 27 or 27 + 45?\n\n**Explanation:** This question is designed to help the student practice identifying the larger quantity in an addition problem. The numbers are presented in a way that requires the student to think about the commutative property of addition, which states that the order of the numbers being added does not change the result. This will help the student build on their existing knowledge and reinforce their understanding of the concept.\n\n**Level of difficulty:** Easy to moderate, as it requires the student to recall and apply their existing knowledge of addition and the commutative property.\n\n**Learning objective:** To assess and build the student's understanding of identifying the larger quantity in an addition problem, specifically with numbers in the range of 40-50.",
