To create an engaging and effective first practice question, I'll design one that targets their current knowledge level and builds upon it.\n\nHere's a question for the student:\n\n**Question:** \nWhich of the following points on the number line represents a negative integer?\n\nA)  0\nB) -3\nC) 5\nD) 0.5\n\n**Number Line Representation:**\nImagine a horizontal line with equally spaced marks labeled with numbers from -5 to 5.\n\nThis question requires the student to apply their understanding of negative integers on a number line by identifying a point that represents a negative integer among the options. The correct answer, -3, is a negative integer, while the other options (0, 5, and 0.5) are either non-negative integers or a non-integer number.\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1.  **Assess current knowledge:** By choosing the correct answer, the student demonstrates their understanding of negative integers on a number line.\n2.  **Build understanding:** The question encourages the student to think critically about the concept and reinforce their knowledge by identifying a negative integer on the number line.\n3.  **Gradually increase difficulty:** This question is a step up from the student's current level, as it requires them to apply their knowledge in a more straightforward manner, without introducing complex concepts or abstract thinking.\n\nAfter attempting this question, I can use the student's response to tailor the next question and adjust the difficulty level to continue building their understanding and confidence in identifying negative integers on a number line.",
