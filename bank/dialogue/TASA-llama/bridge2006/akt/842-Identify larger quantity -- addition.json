The numbers 24 and 56 are relatively close in value, making it a good challenge for the student to compare and identify the larger quantity. The distractors (options C and D) are not relevant to the comparison, and the correct answer (B) is the larger number. This question will help assess the student's understanding and build their confidence in identifying larger quantities through addition.",
