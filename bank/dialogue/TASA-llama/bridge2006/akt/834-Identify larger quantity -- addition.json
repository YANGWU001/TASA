      "content": "Given the student's current knowledge state and needs improvement in the concept of \"Identify larger quantity \u2013 addition,\" I've created a practice question to help assess and build their understanding.\n\n**Practice Question 1:**\n\n\"Tom has 15 pencils in his pencil case. His friend gives him 7 more pencils. How many pencils does Tom have now?\"\n\nThis question is designed to assess the student's ability to apply the concept of addition to identify the larger quantity. Since the student has shown significant knowledge loss in this area, I've kept the numbers relatively small and manageable to help them regain their confidence and build their understanding.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1.  It involves a simple addition problem that requires the student to identify the larger quantity.\n2.  The numbers used are within the student's comfort zone, given their current mastery level.\n3.  The scenario is relatable and easy to understand, making it accessible to the student.\n4.  The question has a clear and straightforward answer, allowing the student to focus on the concept rather than being overwhelmed by complex calculations.\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n\nBy answering this question correctly, the student will demonstrate their ability to apply the concept of addition to identify the larger quantity. If they struggle or answer incorrectly, it will help identify areas where they need additional support and review.",

The correct answer is actually 874, as it is significantly larger than 135. \n\nLet's break it down: when comparing the two numbers in an addition problem, you need to consider their values. In this case, 874 is much greater than 135, so the larger quantity is 874.\n\nDon't worry, this is a common mistake, and it's great that you're willing to learn from it. To improve your skills, let's focus on comparing numbers in addition problems and identifying the larger quantity.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help you regain your confidence and build on your understanding, let's try another Identify larger quantity \u2013 addition question. Here it is:\n\nWhat is the larger quantity in 234 + 67?\n\nA) 234\nB) 67\nC) 301\nD) 301\n\nTake your time, and think about which number is larger.
