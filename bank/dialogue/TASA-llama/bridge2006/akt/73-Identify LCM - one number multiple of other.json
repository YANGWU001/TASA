In this case, 18 is a multiple of 6 (18 = 3 \u00d7 6). The correct answer is 18, as it is the smallest multiple of 6 that 18 can be divided into evenly.\n\n**Expected Response:**\nThe student is expected to recall that the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that both numbers can divide into evenly. They should be able to identify 18 as the correct answer because it is the multiple of 6 that makes it a common multiple.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nThis question will help the student reinforce their understanding of the concept and build their confidence in identifying the LCM when one number is a multiple of the other. It will also help them develop their problem-solving skills by requiring them to think critically about the relationship between the two numbers.",

This is not uncommon, especially after a few days of not practicing. The concept of identifying the least common multiple (LCM) when one number is a multiple of the other can be tricky, and it's essential to keep practicing to solidify your understanding.\n\nTo identify the LCM when one number is a multiple of the other, you need to remember that if one number is a multiple of the other, it means the smaller number can divide the larger number without leaving a remainder. For example, if you have 6 (the smaller number) and 12 (the larger number), since 6 can divide 12 evenly, 6 is the LCM of the two numbers.\n\nLet's try another question to help you reinforce this concept. Here's your next question:\n\nFind the LCM of 8 and 24.",

      "content": "**Explanation of Last Answer:**\nYour last answer was partially correct, but not entirely accurate. You correctly identified that 8 is a factor of 24, which is a crucial insight. However, the LCM (Least Common Multiple) is the smallest number that both 8 and 24 can divide into evenly, not just the smaller number itself. In this case, since 8 can divide 24 evenly, 24 is actually the LCM of 8 and 24 because 24 is a multiple of 8. Think of it this way: if 8 can go into 24 without leaving a remainder, then 24 is the smallest number that both 8 and 24 can divide into evenly.\n\n**Next Question:**\nLet's try another question to help you solidify your understanding. Here it is:\n\nFind the LCM of 4 and 12.\n\nThis question is similar to the previous one, and it's essential to remember that if one number is a multiple of the other, it means the smaller number can divide the larger number without leaving a remainder. Let's see if you can apply this concept correctly this time.",
