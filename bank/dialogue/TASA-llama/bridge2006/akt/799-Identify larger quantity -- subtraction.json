The question also requires the student to perform subtraction mentally or quickly, which will help them build their fluency in this area.\n\n**Expected Response:** The student should be able to identify the correct answer, which is 8 - 5 = 3 (since 8 is larger than 5) and 12 - 7 = 5. The correct answer is 8 - 5.",

The question was about identifying the larger quantity in a subtraction problem. You might have been asked to compare two numbers, like 15 and 7, and determine which one is bigger.\n\nIn this case, you might have forgotten to remember that when you're comparing numbers, you can simply think about which number is bigger in your head. For example, 15 is bigger than 7 because it has more units (or \"15 ones\" vs. \"7 ones\").\n\nDon't worry if you got it wrong \u2013 we're here to practice and learn together! \n\n**Next Question**\n\nNow, let's try another question that's similar, but a bit easier. Here it is:\n\nWhich number is bigger: 9 or 4?\n\nTake your time, and remember: you can compare numbers by thinking about which one has more units.",
