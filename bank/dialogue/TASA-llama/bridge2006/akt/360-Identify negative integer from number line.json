To build upon this understanding, I'll generate a question that assesses their ability to apply this knowledge in a slightly more challenging scenario.\n\n**Practice Question 1:**\n\nConsider the number line below, which shows the integers from -5 to 5:\n\n-5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5\n\nIf you were to move 3 units to the left from the number 0, which integer would you land on?\n\nA) -1\nB) -2\nC) -3\nD) -4\n\n**Objective:**\n\n* This question assesses the student's ability to apply their understanding of negative integers on a number line by asking them to perform a specific operation (moving 3 units to the left from 0).\n* The student needs to correctly identify the integer that corresponds to the new position on the number line.\n\n**Reasoning Skill:**\n\n* This question requires the student to demonstrate their understanding of negative integers and their relative positions on the number line.\n* It also tests their ability to apply this understanding to a specific scenario, which will help build their confidence and fluency in identifying negative integers.\n\n**Adjustments for the Student's Current Knowledge Level:**\n\n* The question starts with a relatively straightforward scenario, allowing the student to build upon their existing knowledge.\n* The number line provided gives the student a visual aid to help them understand the relative positions of the integers.\n* The operation of moving 3 units to the left from 0 is a simple and manageable task, allowing the student to focus on applying their understanding of negative integers.",

The number line shows that -4 is actually closer to -3, not exactly halfway between -3 and -5. To find the exact midpoint between two numbers on a number line, you need to find the average of the two numbers. In this case, the average of -3 and -5 is (-3 + (-5)) / 2 = (-8) / 2 = -4. However, since -4 is closer to -3, we need to go further in the negative direction to find the exact midpoint. So, the correct answer is actually -4.5.\n\n**Why it's incorrect:** You're close, but to find the exact midpoint, we need to average the two numbers, which is (-3 + (-5)) / 2 = -4. Then, to ensure we're exactly between -3 and -5, we need to go halfway from -4 to the next integer, which is -4.5.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nConsidering you've demonstrated a moderate grasp of identifying negative integers on a number line, let's try a question that requires you to apply this understanding to a slightly different scenario. Here's your next question:\n\n**Question:** Look at the number line below and identify the negative integer that is exactly halfway between -2 and 0.\n\n[Number line below]\n\n-10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10\n\nTake your time, and I'll be here to guide you through the process.",
