      "content": "Based on the student's current knowledge state and performance, I recommend a practice question that targets their specific challenges and builds on their existing understanding. Here's a question to help the student improve their skills in calculating the product of two numbers:\n\n**Question:** 4 \u00d7 9 =\n\n**Goal:** To assess and build the student's ability to calculate the product of two single-digit numbers, which is a fundamental skill in multiplication.\n\n**Why this question:** This question is chosen because:\n\n1.  The student has shown modest mastery (44%) and recent performance of 60% accuracy, indicating they can handle single-digit multiplication with some success.\n2.  The numbers 4 and 9 are relatively simple and familiar, reducing cognitive load and allowing the student to focus on the multiplication process.\n3.  The question is straightforward and doesn't involve complex calculations or mental math, making it an ideal starting point for building confidence and accuracy.\n\n**Assessment and feedback:**\n\n*   If the student answers correctly (4 \u00d7 9 = 36), provide positive reinforcement and encouragement, highlighting their understanding of the multiplication process.\n*   If the student answers incorrectly, provide gentle feedback and guidance, explaining the correct calculation (4 \u00d7 9 = 36) and offering additional support to help them understand the concept.\n\nThis question will help the student build their confidence and accuracy in calculating the product of two numbers, laying the foundation for more complex multiplication problems in the future.",
