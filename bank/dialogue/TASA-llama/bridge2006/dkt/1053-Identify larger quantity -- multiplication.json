The numbers used are relatively small, making it easier for the student to compute the products. The correct answer requires the student to recognize that 2 \u00d7 6 = 12 and 3 \u00d7 5 = 15, and that 15 is larger than 12. This question will help the student build confidence and develop their skills in identifying larger quantities in multiplication problems.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n- Encourage the student to use their knowledge of multiplication facts to solve the problem.\n- Remind them that when comparing two products, they need to calculate each product separately before deciding which one is larger.\n- If the student struggles, provide a visual aid, such as drawing arrays or using blocks, to help them visualize the multiplication process.",
