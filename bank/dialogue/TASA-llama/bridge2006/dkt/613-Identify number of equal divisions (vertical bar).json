You also correctly applied the concept of splitting each part into two smaller, equal pieces, which would result in twice as many sections. Your answer of 12 equal divisions is correct. Well done!\n\n**Breaking down your thought process:**\n\nYou recognized that the initial division of the bar into 6 equal parts is a starting point. When you divide each of these parts into two smaller, equal pieces, you effectively create two new divisions within each of the original 6 parts. This means that the total number of equal divisions increases by the number of parts you divided each of the original parts into, which in this case is 2. Therefore, the correct calculation is 6 (initial divisions) x 2 (additional divisions per part) = 12 equal divisions.\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\n**Question:** \n\nA picture shows a bar divided into 8 equal parts.

You correctly identified that the bar is first divided into 8 equal parts, and then each part is further divided into 3 equal pieces. However, your calculation of 8 x 3 = 24 is close, but not quite correct. Remember that each of the 8 parts is being divided into 3 equal pieces, so you should multiply the number of original parts by the number of new pieces per part, and then multiply again by the number of new pieces each of those parts can be divided into. Think of it this way: 8 x 3 = 24, but then each of those 24 parts can be divided into 3 equal pieces, so you'll get 24 x 3 = 72. Well, that's not the answer you're looking for, let's try again.\n\n**Let's break it down:**\n\n- First, you divide the bar into 8 equal parts.\n- Then, each of those parts is divided into 3 equal pieces.\n- To find the total number of equal divisions, you multiply the number of original parts by the number of new pieces per part: 8 x 3 = 24.\n- Finally, each of those 24 parts can be divided into 3 equal pieces, so you'll get 24 x 3 = 72, but that's not the total, that's the number of divisions in each of the 8 parts, so you have to multiply by the number of parts, which is 8, but you already did that, so you just have to multiply by 3 again.\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\n**Question:**\n\nA picture shows a bar divided into 4 equal parts.
