Here's the next question:\n\n**Question:**\n\nWhich number is larger in the following addition problem:\n\n27 + 15 = ?\n\nA) 41\nB) 42\nC) 40\nD) 39\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThis question assesses the student's ability to identify the larger quantity in a slightly more challenging addition problem. The numbers involved are still manageable, but the sum is slightly larger, requiring the student to apply their understanding of addition to make an accurate choice. The options provided are clear and distinct, making it easier for the student to make an accurate choice.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\nI expect the student to correctly identify the larger quantity, which is 42. This will help them build confidence in their understanding of the concept and provide a foundation for further practice and improvement.",
