This requires identifying the multiples of both numbers and finding the smallest common multiple.\n\n**Hint:** The student can start by listing the multiples of 6 (6, 12, 18, 24, 30, ...) and the multiples of 8 (8, 16, 24, 32, ...). They should then identify the smallest number that appears in both lists, which is 24.\n\nThis question will help the student assess their understanding of the concept and build on their current knowledge.",
