If you move 5 units to the right, where will you be?\n\nA) -8\nB) -2\nC) 2\nD) 7\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* This question assesses the student's ability to understand the concept of moving on a number line and their ability to calculate the new position after a certain number of units are moved.\n* The student is already familiar with identifying negative integers on a number line, so this question reinforces that concept while introducing a new aspect: moving on the number line.\n* The correct answer, 2, requires the student to apply their understanding of negative integers and movement on the number line. They need to subtract 5 from -3 to arrive at the correct answer.\n* The distractors (A, B, and D) are plausible but incorrect, making it a challenging question that requires the student to think critically about their understanding of negative integers and movement on the number line.\n\nThis question will help the student build their confidence and understanding of negative integers on a number line while addressing their area of improvement.",

If you move 4 units to the left, where will you be?\n\nA) -5\nB) -13\nC) -11\nD) -7\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThis question will challenge you to apply your understanding of movement on the number line to a starting point with a negative value. You'll need to subtract 4 from -9 to find the correct answer. Remember, moving to the left means subtracting, so you'll be counting backward on the number line. Take your time, and think carefully about the calculation involved.\n\nThis question will help you solidify your understanding of negative integers and movement on the number line while applying it to a new scenario.",

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYour answer, C) -11, is incorrect. You initially correctly identified that moving to the left on the number line means subtracting the given number, in this case, 4. However, you then applied the calculation -9 - 4, which results in -13. Your reasoning about considering an alternative answer due to confusion between \"left\" and \"right\" is a great thinking process, but in this case, it led to an incorrect conclusion. Don't worry, it's a common mistake, and you're doing great in understanding the concept of movement on the number line.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Practice Question 9:**\n\nImagine you are standing on the number line at -3.
