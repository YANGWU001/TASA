The correct answer is B) 5, as 2 + 5 is indeed larger than 1 + 2. This question requires the student to apply their understanding of addition and compare the results to identify the larger quantity.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n* The numbers used are relatively small, making it easier for the student to focus on the concept of identifying larger quantities rather than getting bogged down in complex calculations.\n* The question requires the student to apply their understanding of addition and compare the results, which is a key aspect of the \"Identify larger quantity \u2013 addition\" concept.\n* The options are clear and concise, allowing the student to make an informed decision without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nBy answering this question correctly, the student will demonstrate their understanding of identifying larger quantities in addition, and we can build upon this concept in future practice questions.",
