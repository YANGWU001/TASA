The numbers 2 and 5 are relatively easy to work with, and the answer choices are straightforward. The student should be able to recognize that 2 \u00d7 5 is indeed greater than 5, but less than 10. This question will help the student practice their understanding of comparing quantities in multiplication, which is a fundamental concept in this topic.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n* It's a simple multiplication problem that requires minimal calculation, allowing the student to focus on the concept of comparing quantities.\n* The answer choices are clear and concise, making it easy for the student to identify the correct answer.\n* The question is not too difficult or too easy, given the student's current knowledge level and mastery score of approximately 33%.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nAfter the student attempts this question, we can review their answer and provide feedback to reinforce their understanding of the concept. If they struggle or answer incorrectly, we can break down the problem further and provide additional guidance to help them build their skills.",
