It seems that the student needs to focus on accurately counting the number of steps and ensuring they shade the correct number of boxes.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current knowledge state and the need for improvement in understanding the concept of \"Identify larger quantity \u2013 subtraction,\" the next question will focus on another aspect of the concept: \"Enter subtracted quantity in diagram.\" This time, the difficulty level will be moderate.\n\n**Question:**\n\nProblem: 85 - 32 = ?\n\n**Task:** Draw a number line and shade the boxes to show the subtraction. Remember to put a subtraction symbol between the numbers.\n\n**Diagram:**\n\n   90 | 89 | 88 | 87 | 86 | 85 | 84 | 83 | 82 | 81 | 80 | 79 | 78 | 77 | 76 | 75 | 74 | 73 | 72 | 71 | 70 | 69 | 68 | 67 | 66 | 65 | 64 | 63 | 62 | 61 | 60 | 59 | 58 | 57 | 56 | 55 | 54 | 53 | 52 | 51 | 50 | 49 | 48 | 47 | 46 | 45 | 44 | 43 | 42 | 41 | 40 | 39 | 38 | 37 | 36 | 35 | 34 | 33 | 32 | 31 | 30 | 29 | 28 | 27 | 26 | 25 | 24 | 23 | 22 | 21 | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0\n\n**Hint:** Start by finding the starting point, then subtract the given number. Remember to count carefully and shade the correct number of boxes.",
