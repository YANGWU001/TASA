You correctly identified the concept of counting the number of vertical bars and spaces between them to find the total number of divisions.

Since there are 105 bars, there are 104 spaces between them (because the number of spaces is always one less than the number of bars). \n\nUsing the correct count, the total number of divisions would be 105 (bars) + 104 (spaces) = 209, which is a great calculation. However, this figure actually represents only the vertical bars and spaces between them.

However, there are a couple of areas where you're still a bit unsure. Let's break it down:\n\nYou correctly counted the vertical bars and spaces between them, which is great. You also remembered to add 2 extra spaces for the beginning and end of the figure. However, you're unsure about whether the \"extra spaces\" are always counted as 2 or sometimes only 1. The correct rule is that the extra spaces at the beginning and end of the figure are always counted as 2, regardless of whether the figure starts or ends at the edge.\n\nRegarding the spaces between the bars, you're right to be confused. To clarify, the spaces that are directly next to a bar do count as \"between\" the bars. So, if you have a figure with 7 vertical bars, you would count the 6 spaces between the bars, not the 7 spaces including the ones next to the bars.\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nLet's try another problem to help solidify your understanding.
