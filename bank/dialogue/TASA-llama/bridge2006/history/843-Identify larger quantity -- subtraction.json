It's essential to start with simple questions to help the student build confidence and develop their skills. The answer choices are clear, and the student can easily determine which number is larger.\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n- It's a basic comparison, which is a fundamental aspect of identifying larger quantities.\n- It doesn't require any complex calculations, focusing on the student's ability to recognize larger quantities.\n- The answer is not ambiguous, making it easier for the student to identify the correct choice.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nAfter the student answers this question, I'll provide feedback and guidance to help them understand the concept. If they struggle or answer incorrectly, I'll adjust the difficulty level and provide additional support to help them build their understanding. If they answer correctly, we'll move on to more challenging questions to further reinforce their learning.",
