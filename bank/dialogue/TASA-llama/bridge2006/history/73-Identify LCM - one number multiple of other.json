Since the student retains moderate knowledge (38% accuracy) and shows moderate forgetting (0.095), the question will be designed to assess their understanding and build upon it.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nWhat is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 12 and 24?\n\nA) 6\nB) 12\nC) 24\nD) 48\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis question is designed to assess the student's understanding of identifying LCM when one number is a multiple of the other. Since 24 is a multiple of 12 (24 = 2 \u00d7 12), the LCM of 12 and 24 is simply 24. This question will help the student practice their ability to identify the LCM in a scenario where one number is a multiple of the other.\n\n**Additional Guidance:**\n\nTo help the student build upon their understanding, I would provide the following guidance:\n\n* Remind the student that when one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is simply the larger number.\n* Ask the student to think about why 24 is the LCM in this case (e.g., \"Why is 24 the smallest common multiple of 12 and 24?\").\n* Provide feedback on their answer, highlighting any mistakes or areas for improvement.",

Since 24 is a multiple of 12 (24 = 2 \u00d7 12), we can see that 12 is a factor of 24. In this case, the LCM of 12 and 24 is indeed 24 because it is the smallest multiple that both numbers have in common. Well done for thinking that the bigger number might be the LCM, and you're on the right track!\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nTo build upon your understanding, let's try a slightly more challenging scenario.

You're considering the relationship between 4 and 12, but you're not quite getting it right. You pointed out that 4 and 12 share a common factor of 4, but you're not thinking about the multiples of the numbers correctly. The LCM of 4 and 12 is actually 12, not 8, because 12 is a multiple of 4 and is the smallest multiple that both numbers have in common.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try a question that involves numbers that are not as straightforward. What is the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 6 and 9?\n\nA) 6\nB) 9\nC) 18\nD) 36\n\n**Additional Guidance:**\n\n* Think about the factors of both numbers and how they relate to each other. In this case, what are the common factors of 6 and 9?\n* Consider how the multiples of each number might help you find the LCM.\n* Remember, the LCM is the smallest multiple that both numbers have in common.\n* This question will help you apply your understanding of LCM to a scenario where the numbers have a clear relationship, and you can use your knowledge of factors and multiples to find the correct answer.\n\nThis question will challenge you to think critically about the factors and multiples of the given numbers and will help you build on your understanding of LCM.
