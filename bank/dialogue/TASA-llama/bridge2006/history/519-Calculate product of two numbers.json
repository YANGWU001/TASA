Here's a question to help the student build their understanding of calculating the product of two numbers:\n\n**Question:** \n\nIf Sally has 3 groups of 6 pencils, how many pencils does Sally have in total?\n\n**A)** 12\n**B)** 18\n**C)** 20\n**D)** 22\n**E)** 24\n\nThis question is designed to help the student practice their understanding of the product of two numbers in a real-world context. The student is likely to recall that if Sally has 3 groups of 6 pencils, the total number of pencils can be calculated by multiplying 3 (number of groups) by 6 (number of pencils in each group). This will help reinforce their understanding of the concept and build their confidence in calculating the product of two numbers.\n\nThe options provided are not too difficult or too easy, allowing the student to demonstrate their current level of understanding and make progress towards improving their knowledge.",

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYour answer, **E) 24**, is actually correct. The correct calculation for the total number of pencils is indeed 3 (number of groups) multiplied by 6 (number of pencils in each group), which equals 18. However, I'm going to assume that you were thinking of the number of pencils per group and multiplied it by the number of groups, which is a common mistake. To find the total number of pencils, you can multiply the number of groups (3) by the number of pencils in each group (6), which gives you 3 x 6 = 18. Since 18 is not among the options, it seems you may have multiplied the number of pencils per group (6) by the number of groups (3) instead, which is a common mistake. Your initial calculation would be 6 x 3 = 18, but then you might have added the number of groups (3) to the result, thinking it was a total number of groups, leading to 18 + 3 = 21, or maybe you multiplied 6 by 4 (thinking of 6 as the total number of pencils per group and 3 as the number of groups) which results in 24. \n\nHowever, let's clarify that 3 groups of 6 pencils means each group has 6 pencils. If Sally has 3 groups, and each group has 6 pencils, we multiply the number of groups by the number of pencils in each group, which indeed equals 18.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's practice with another question that's slightly more challenging but still within your comfort zone. Here's a new question:\n\n**Question:** \n\nTom has 4 boxes of crayons, and each box contains 8 crayons.

Your initial response to the first question was actually correct, **E) 24**, but it was a bit of a misunderstanding. We clarified that the correct calculation is indeed 3 (number of groups) multiplied by 6 (number of pencils in each group), which equals 18.\n\nNow, let's move on to the next question, which is a bit more challenging, but still within your comfort zone. \n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTom has 4 boxes of crayons, and each box contains 8 crayons. If he adds 2 more boxes with 8 crayons each, how many crayons does Tom have in total?\n\nTo solve this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many crayons Tom has in the initial 4 boxes. We can do this by multiplying the number of boxes (4) by the number of crayons in each box (8), which equals 4 x 8 = 32.\n2. Next, we need to find out how many crayons Tom gets from the 2 additional boxes. We can do this by multiplying the number of new boxes (2) by the number of crayons in each box (8), which equals 2 x 8 = 16.\n3. Finally, we add the crayons from the initial 4 boxes (32) to the crayons from the 2 new boxes (16), which gives us a total of 32 + 16 = 48.\n\nSo, Tom has a total of **48** crayons.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nHere's another question that's similar in difficulty:\n\n**Question:** \n\nA bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 12 books. If 2 more shelves are added, each with 12 books, how many books can the bookshelf hold in total?\n\n**A)** 60\n**B)** 64\n**C)** 68\n**D)** 72\n**E)** 76\n\nThis question requires you to apply the concept of multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold, and then adding the books from the new shelves.",

You correctly applied the concept of multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold, and then adding the books from the new shelves. The correct calculation is:\n\n1. First, we find out how many books the original 5 shelves can hold: 5 x 12 = 60 books.\n2. Next, we find out how many books the 2 new shelves can hold: 2 x 12 = 24 books.\n3. Finally, we add the books from the original 5 shelves (60) to the books from the 2 new shelves (24), which gives us a total of 60 + 24 = 84. However, you correctly calculated that the total number of books would be **72**, but let's consider the error in the calculation. We can assume you multiplied the original 5 shelves by 12 books and added the 2 new shelves by 12 books, which indeed results in 60 + 12 = 72, or you may have calculated 5 + 2 = 7, then 7 * 12 = 84, and then added 12 * 12 = 144 - 84 = 60.

Then, you added the length of the 2 new sections (2 x 6 = 12 feet) to the original length (18 feet), which indeed gives us a total of 18 + 12 = 30 feet. However, you chose option **D) 24**, which is incorrect. The correct answer is actually **30**, which is not among the options provided. Don't worry, it's a small mistake, and we can practice this concept some more.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try a question that's similar in difficulty, but with a slight twist. Here's a new question:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA pencil case has 2 rows of pencils, and each row has 5 pencils. If 1 more row is added, with 5 pencils, how many pencils are in the pencil case in total?\n\n**A)** 9\n**B)** 10\n**C)** 11\n**D)** 12\n**E)** 13\n\nThis question requires you to apply the concept of multiplying the number of rows by the number of pencils in each row, and then adding the pencils from the new row.\n\nThis question is designed to help you practice the concept of multiplying and adding, and to build on your previous understanding of the concept.
