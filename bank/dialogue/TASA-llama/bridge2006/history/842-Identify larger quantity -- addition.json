The question will be designed to assess their ability to identify larger quantities through addition and provide a gentle challenge to help build their confidence.\n\n**Question:** \n\n\"Tom has 5 pencils in his pencil case. His friend, Alex, gives him 2 more pencils. How many pencils does Tom have now?\"\n\n**Answer Choices:**\n\nA) 3\nB) 5\nC) 7\nD) 10\n\n**Explanation:** This question assesses the student's understanding of adding a smaller quantity (2) to a larger quantity (5) to determine the total amount. It's a simple and concrete scenario that should be within the student's grasp. The answer choices are straightforward, making it easier for the student to choose the correct response.",

You had a good idea to break down the subtraction into steps, but you didn't continue with the correct borrowing process.\n\n**Let's break it down:**\n\nTo subtract 37 from 147, you need to borrow from the tens place. First, you can subtract 30 from 100 (100 - 30 = 70), then subtract 7 from 70 (70 - 7 = 63). Then, you need to borrow again (10 - 3 = 7), and subtract 30 from 70 (70 - 30 = 40), and 40 - 7 = 33. Finally, you need to add 30 (10 + 30 = 40) and 7 (7 + 7 = 14) to get the correct answer of 110.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nSince you're practicing subtraction with larger numbers, let's try a question that involves regrouping numbers with a smaller difference and a smaller starting number. Here it is:\n\n\"Emily has 95 stickers in her sticker book. She gives 12 stickers to her brother.
