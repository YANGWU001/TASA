You correctly identified that multiplying 5 by 5 gives 25, but you didn't compare it with the other options. Let's take a closer look. When you multiply each option by 5:\n\n- 5 \u00d7 2 = 10\n- 5 \u00d7 5 = 25\n- 5 \u00d7 8 = 40\n- 5 \u00d7 9 = 45\n\nAs you can see, 5 \u00d7 9 = 45 is actually the largest product among the options. So, the correct answer is **D) 9**. Don't worry, it's a common mistake to overlook the other options. You're doing great, and with a bit more practice, you'll become more confident in identifying larger quantities through multiplication.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help you build on your momentum and solidify your understanding of identifying larger quantities through multiplication, here's another question tailored to your current knowledge level:\n\n**Question:** Which of the following numbers is **LARGER** when multiplied by 3?\n\nA) 2\nB) 4\nC) 6\nD) 7\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1.
