In this case, -6 is the correct answer.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nTo help reinforce your understanding of negative integers on a number line, let's try a question that requires you to think about the relationships between negative integers and their positions on the line. Here's your next practice question:\n\n**Question:**\n\n\"Consider the number line below and identify the number that is between -3 and 0.
