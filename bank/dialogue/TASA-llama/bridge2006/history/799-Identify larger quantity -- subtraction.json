However, it's essential to continue practicing to solidify their understanding and build their confidence.\n\n**Next Question:**\nTo help the student further reinforce their understanding and build their confidence, let's try a question with a slight twist. Here's the next practice question:\n\n8 - 3 = ?\n\nA) 4\nB) 5\nC) 6\nD) 9\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis question is designed to challenge the student's ability to identify the larger quantity in a simple subtraction problem. The numbers are slightly larger, but still manageable, and the correct answer requires the student to apply their understanding of subtraction. By using a mix of larger and smaller numbers, we can help the student develop their skills and build their accuracy.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\nThis question targets the student's ability to:\n\n1. Identify the larger quantity in a simple subtraction problem.\n2. Recall and apply the concept of subtraction to find the larger quantity.\n\n**Adjustments for Forgetting:**\nGiven the student's recent progress, I have designed this question to:\n\n1. Gradually increase the difficulty by using a mix of larger and smaller numbers.\n2. Encourage the student to apply their understanding of subtraction to find the larger quantity.\n3. Provide a clear and straightforward question, allowing the student to build their confidence and accuracy.\n\nBy continuing with these practice questions, the student will be able to reinforce their understanding and develop a stronger foundation for future learning.",
