It is a basic addition concept, but one that the student has shown difficulty with in the past. By answering this question, the student will be able to demonstrate their understanding of the concept and receive feedback on their accuracy.\n\n**Reasoning Skill:**\nTo answer this question correctly, the student will need to recall the concept of comparing numbers and identifying the larger quantity. This requires basic addition skills, but also an understanding of the concept of quantity and comparison. The student will need to recognize that 27 is greater than 15, making it the larger quantity.\n\n**Adjustments for Forgetting:**\nTo help the student overcome their high forgetting level, I will provide a clear and concise explanation of the correct answer, and encourage them to review and practice the concept multiple times. I will also provide additional practice questions that build on this concept, gradually increasing in difficulty as the student becomes more confident.",

Remember, the key is to compare the values of the numbers and think about which one is greater. In this case, 56 is larger because it has a higher value. This is a great step forward in your practice, and I'm proud of you for applying the concept correctly.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build on your previous attempts. Here it is:\n\nWhat is the larger quantity between 73 and 28?\n\nA) 73\nB) 28\nC) 92\nD) 48\n\n**Why this question?**\nThis question is similar to the previous ones, but with numbers that are a bit larger. I'm giving you a chance to practice the concept with numbers that are a bit more challenging, but still manageable. Remember to compare the values of the numbers and think about which one is greater. Take your time, and think carefully about the numbers. What do you think is the larger quantity between 73 and 28?",
