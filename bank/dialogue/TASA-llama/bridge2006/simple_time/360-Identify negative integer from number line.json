Here's a question to help the student build their understanding of identifying negative integers on a number line:\n\n**Question 1:** \n\nIdentify which of the following numbers is a negative integer on the number line?\n\nA) -5\nB) 0\nC) 2\nD) -3\n\n**Explanation:** This question assesses the student's ability to recognize negative integers on a number line. The correct answer, -5, is a clear example of a negative integer. The other options, 0, 2, and -3, are either positive integers or another negative integer, respectively. This question requires the student to apply their understanding of negative integers and their placement on a number line.\n\n**Reasoning Skill:** This question requires the student to recall and apply their knowledge of negative integers, demonstrating their understanding of the concept. The student should be able to identify the negative integer (-5) and rule out the other options as incorrect.\n\n**Adjustments for student's knowledge level:** The question is designed to be moderately challenging, with a clear correct answer and distractors that are plausible but incorrect. The student's current knowledge level suggests they may struggle with identifying negative integers on a number line, so this question will help them practice and build their confidence in this area.",

They demonstrated an understanding of negative integers on a number line by correctly identifying -3 as a negative integer because it is located to the left of zero. However, there's a slight confusion in their explanation, as they mentioned -5 being to the left of zero as well, which is true. Both -5 and -3 are indeed negative integers and would be to the left of zero on a number line.
