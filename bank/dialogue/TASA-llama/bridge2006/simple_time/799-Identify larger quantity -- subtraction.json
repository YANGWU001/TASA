Which one has more pencils?\n\n**A)** Sara\n**B)** Alex\n**C)** They have the same amount\n**D)** We can't compare\n\n**Diagram:**\nImagine a simple diagram with two boxes, one labeled \"Sara\" and the other labeled \"Alex\". Sara's box has 15 pencils drawn inside, and Alex's box has 7 pencils drawn inside.\n\n**Task:** Identify the larger quantity (the one with more pencils) and mark the correct answer choice.\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1.  Assess the student's ability to identify the larger quantity in a simple subtraction scenario.\n2.  Gradually increase difficulty by introducing a real-life scenario and a simple diagram.\n3.  Help the student build confidence by providing a clear and straightforward question.\n4.  Evaluate their understanding of the concept and provide feedback for improvement.\n\nThis question is tailored to the student's current knowledge level, and the diagram will help them visualize the quantities being compared, making it easier for them to identify the larger quantity.",

Initially, Shelf 1 had 135 books and Shelf 2 had 90 books. When 27 books were removed from Shelf 1, it now has 135 - 27 = 108 books.
