      "content": "**Explanation of Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYour answer, **15**, is incorrect for the question about the number of equal divisions between the fifth and the twenty-first vertical bar on a number line with 30 equal parts marked with vertical bars. To determine the correct answer, let's count the spaces between the fifth and the twenty-first bar: 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16, 16-17, 17-18, 18-19, 19-20, 20-21. This totals 15 divisions. However, you should have counted the spaces from the fifth bar to the twenty-first bar, which means you should have included the space from the fifth bar to the sixth bar. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed **A) 16** divisions (5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16, 16-17, 17-18, 18-19, 19-20, and 20-21). Don't worry, it's an easy mistake, and you'll get the hang of it with practice.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question that builds on this idea.

You're now counting the divisions between the third and the nineteenth bar, which should be a bit more challenging than counting the divisions between the first and last bar or between the second and eleventh bar. Take your time, and remember, you can count the spaces or use the formula to find the answer.",
