The student is expected to recall the factors of 12, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. This question will help the student build their confidence in identifying factors, which is a crucial step in finding the Highest Common Factor (HCF).\n\n**Why this question is suitable for the student:**\n\n* It's an easy difficulty level, which is suitable for a student who has shown low mastery (~33%) of the concept.\n* It targets a basic understanding of factors, which is a foundational concept that the student needs to grasp before moving on to more complex topics like HCF.\n* The options are clear and concise, making it easy for the student to understand and choose the correct answer.\n\n**What to look for:**\n\nIf the student answers this question correctly, it indicates that they have a good grasp of factors and are ready to move on to more complex questions related to HCF. If they struggle or answer incorrectly, it may suggest that they need more practice or review on the concept of factors before moving forward.",

The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24, and the factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. Both 24 and 36 can be divided by 2, which is indeed a common factor. In fact, 2 is the largest number that divides both 24 and 36 without leaving a remainder, making it the highest common factor (HCF) of 24 and 36. Well done!

The student needs to identify the factors of both 30 and 42, and then determine which factor is common to both numbers. This question assesses the student's ability to analyze and apply their knowledge of factors to a moderate-level problem.\n\n**Why this question is suitable for the student:**\n\n* It's a medium difficulty level, which is suitable for a student who has demonstrated a basic understanding of factors and HCF.\n* It requires the student to apply their knowledge of factors to a slightly more challenging problem, which will help them build confidence and reinforce their understanding.\n* The numbers 30 and 42 are not too difficult to factor, making it an excellent opportunity for the student to practice and refine their skills.\n\n**What to look for:**\n\nIf the student answers this question correctly, it indicates that they are making progress in understanding the concept of HCF and can apply it to moderate-level problems.
