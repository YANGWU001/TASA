If she wants to pack these packets into smaller boxes, which holds 4 pencils each, how many smaller boxes can she fill with the packets of pencils from 1 box?\"\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n- This question assesses the student's understanding of division within BIDMAS, which is an area where they need improvement (mastery \u2248 30%).\n- The question is straightforward, with a clear and relatable scenario, making it easier for the student to focus on the math concept rather than getting overwhelmed.\n- The student can use mental multiplication and division to solve the problem, which is a skill they are working to develop (mastery \u2248 30%).\n- The question also encourages the student to think about the process of breaking down a problem into smaller parts and applying BIDMAS rules to solve it.\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n\n- If the student answers correctly, it will indicate that they have a good understanding of division within BIDMAS and can apply it to a real-world scenario.\n- If the student answers incorrectly, it will provide an opportunity to identify areas where they need additional practice and support, and to adjust their learning strategy accordingly.",
