Here's a practice question to help them build their understanding of Prime Numbers and Prime Factors:\n\n**Question:** What is the prime factorization of the number 30?\n\n**Explanation:** The prime factorization of a number is the expression of that number as the product of its prime factors. For example, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3.\n\n**Your task:** Write the prime factorization of 30.\n\n**Hint:** Think about the numbers that multiply together to give 30.\n\nThis question assesses the student's ability to apply their understanding of prime numbers and prime factors to a simple example. The student can use their current knowledge to attempt the question, and I'll provide feedback to help them understand where they're going wrong and guide them towards the correct solution.",

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. The student correctly recalled this definition but applied it incorrectly to the number 6. To find the smallest prime number greater than 5, we need to look for a number that meets the definition of a prime number. The correct answer is actually 7, as it can only be divided by 1 and itself.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help the student solidify their understanding of prime numbers, let's try a question that reinforces the concept of prime numbers and composite numbers.\n\n**Question:** Identify whether the number 9 is a prime number or a composite number.\n\n**Explanation:** This question is a good opportunity for the student to apply their understanding of prime numbers and composite numbers. By identifying whether 9 is a prime or composite number, the student will demonstrate their ability to recognize the properties of numbers and apply the definition of prime numbers.",
