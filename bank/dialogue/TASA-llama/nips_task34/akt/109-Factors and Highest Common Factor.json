Here's a question that should help assess and build their understanding:\n\n**Question:** Find the highest common factor (HCF) of the numbers 12 and 18.\n\n**Reasoning:** To solve this problem, the student needs to find the factors of both numbers, which are 12 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12) and 18 (1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18). Then, they need to identify the common factors, which are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Finally, they need to determine the highest common factor, which is 6.\n\n**Expected answer:** 6\n\n**Difficulty Level:** This question is designed to be moderately challenging for a student with 33% accuracy in Factors and Highest Common Factor. It requires them to recall and apply the concept of finding factors and identifying the highest common factor, which is a fundamental skill in this topic.\n\n**Learning Goal:** This question aims to help the student:\n\n1. Recall the concept of factors and highest common factor.\n2. Apply the concept to find the factors of two numbers.\n3. Identify the common factors between two numbers.\n4. Determine the highest common factor.\n\nBy answering this question correctly, the student will demonstrate their understanding of the concept and be able to build upon it in future practice questions.",

You correctly listed the factors of both numbers, but incorrectly identified the common factors. The common factors of 35 and 50 are indeed 1 and 5, not 7. 7 is a factor of 35, but it is not a factor of 50. You also mentioned that 50 is close to 49, but that's not relevant to finding the common factors. Remember, to find the common factors, you need to look for the numbers that appear in both lists of factors.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\nLet's try another question to help you build your understanding of factors and highest common factor. Here's a new question:\n\n**Question:** Find the highest common factor (HCF) of the numbers 18 and 24.\n\n**Reasoning:** To solve this problem, you'll need to find the factors of both numbers.

Finally, you'll need to determine the highest common factor, which is the largest of these common factors.\n\n**Expected answer:** 6\n\n**Difficulty Level:** This question is designed to be slightly more challenging than the previous one, as it requires you to find the factors of two larger numbers and identify the common factors. This will help you build your confidence and fluency in applying the concept of factors and highest common factor.\n\n**Learning Goal:** This question aims to help you:\n\n1.
