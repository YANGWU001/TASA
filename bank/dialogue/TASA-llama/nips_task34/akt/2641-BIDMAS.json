Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 5 + 8 = 13\n2. Multiply 2 by the result: 2 \u00d7 13 = 26\n3. Divide 26 by 2: 26 \u00f7 2 = 13\n\nHowever, you initially mentioned dividing the 2 first, which would give you 2 \u00d7 13 = 26 and then 26 \u00f7 2 = 13, which is incorrect. Thankfully, you corrected yourself and understood that the correct order is to perform the multiplication before the division. Your final answer of 20 is incorrect because you didn't actually perform the division after the multiplication.\n\nDon't worry, though - you're on the right track, and it's great that you caught your mistake and corrected it.

They correctly evaluated the expressions inside the parentheses (5 - 1 = 4 and 2 + 1 = 3), but then made a mistake in the order of operations. They added the results of the expressions (4 + 3 = 7) instead of multiplying them (4 \u00d7 3 = ?). The correct calculation is to multiply 4 by 3 (4 \u00d7 3 = 12), not add them. The student's answer of 8 is incorrect because they didn't follow the correct order of operations.\n\nDon't worry, though - you're close, and it's great that you're trying to apply the order of operations. Keep practicing, and you'll get the hang of it!\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nHere's another question for you to practice your BIDMAS skills:\n\n(4 + 2) \u00d7 (1 - 3)\n\n**Instructions:** Use the BIDMAS rules to evaluate the expression mentally.\n\n**Note:** This question requires you to apply the order of operations, specifically the addition and subtraction parts, and then multiplication.
