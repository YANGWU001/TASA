However, based on the definition of an obtuse angle, which is an angle whose measure is greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees, we can see that angle **T** should be greater than 90 degrees. Since you mentioned that the picture looks \"open\" but not super wide, it suggests that angle **T** is indeed obtuse, but your answer choice is incorrect because it is not a right angle. A more accurate answer would be a measure that is greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nTo help you better understand obtuse angles, let's try a question that provides a clear example.
