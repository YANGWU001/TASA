First, subtract 5 from both sides:\n\n2x + 5 - 5 > 11 - 5\n2x > 6\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2:\n\n2x / 2 > 6 / 2\nx > 3\n\nThe correct answer is **A)** x > 3.\n\n**Why this question?**\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1. Review the student's understanding of basic algebraic operations (subtraction and division).\n2. Assess their ability to isolate the variable in a linear inequality.\n3. Gradually increase the difficulty by introducing a simple inequality with a positive coefficient (2) and a positive constant term (6).\n\nThis question should help the student build confidence and reinforce their understanding of solving linear inequalities.",

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's answer, **x < 6**, is incorrect. Although the student's thought process shows an attempt to isolate the variable \\(x\\) by dividing both sides of the inequality by 2, their final answer is incorrect.\n\nThe student correctly identified the need to get rid of the 2 that's multiplying \\(x\\) by dividing both sides of the inequality by 2, resulting in \\(\\frac{2x}{2} > \\frac{12}{2}\\), which simplifies to \\(x > 6\\). However, they incorrectly stated that the inequality sign should flip when dividing by a positive number. When dividing both sides of the inequality \\(2x > 12\\) by a positive number (2), the inequality sign remains the same.\n\n**Why is the student's answer not entirely incorrect?**\n\nWhile the student's final answer is incorrect, their effort to apply the concept of isolating the variable by dividing both sides demonstrates a good understanding of the basic algebraic operation. However, they need to pay closer attention to the properties of inequalities when performing operations.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding and the need for further practice with isolating variables in linear inequalities, here's a new question:\n\n**Question:**\n\nSolve the inequality: x - 4 < 7\n\n**A)** x > 11\n**B)** x < 11\n**C)** x > 3\n**D)** x < 3\n\n**Guidance:**\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1. Review the student's understanding of basic algebraic operations (subtraction).\n2. Assess their ability to isolate the variable in a linear inequality.\n3. Gradually increase the difficulty by introducing a simple inequality with a variable on one side and a constant on the other.\n\nThe student is encouraged to work through the solution step by step, using the same logic as before: adding 4 to both sides of the inequality to isolate the variable \\(x\\). This will help solidify their understanding of the concept and build confidence in their problem-solving skills.\n\nTo answer this question correctly, the student can follow these steps:\n\n1. Add 4 to both sides of the inequality to get \\(x - 4 + 4 < 7 + 4\\).\n2. Simplify both sides of the inequality to get \\(x < 11\\).\n\nThis will lead to the correct answer, **B) x < 11**.",
