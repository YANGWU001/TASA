The student has a moderate level of mastery, so they should be able to recall the definition and basic concept of LCM.\n2.  The numbers 8 and 12 are not too large or too small, making it a good challenge for the student to apply their knowledge.\n3.  This question will help the student practice finding the LCM of two relatively simple numbers, which is a fundamental skill in the concept.\n\n**What to expect from the student:**\n\n- The student should be able to recall the definition of LCM.\n- They should be able to list the multiples of 8 and 12.\n- The student should be able to identify the smallest multiple that is common to both 8 and 12.\n\n**Example solutions:**\n\nTo find the LCM of 8 and 12:\n\n1.

The correct answer is 30, which is the smallest number that appears in both lists of multiples. You correctly identified that 60 is a multiple of both 6 and 15, but you didn't consider the multiples of 6 and 15 before 60. A correct approach would be to continue listing multiples until you find the smallest one that appears in both lists.

The correct approach is to list multiples until you find the smallest one that appears in both lists.
