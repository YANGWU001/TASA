Your answer, **B) A number that can be divided evenly by any other number except 1 and itself**, is actually the opposite of the correct definition of a prime number. A prime number is a number that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself, not by any other number. Think of it like this: if a number can be divided evenly by another number, it's not a prime number.\n\nFor example, the number 6 can be divided evenly by 2 and 3, so it's not a prime number. On the other hand, the number 5 can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself, so it is a prime number.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build on this concept.

Although you're trying to apply the definition of a prime number, which is a number that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself, you're actually using this definition incorrectly. You're correct that 4 can only be divided by 1 and itself, but this is not true for all prime numbers. A prime number must be greater than 1, and 4 is not a prime number because it has more than two factors (1, 2, and 4). The correct prime number from the options is actually **C) 7**, because 7 can only be divided evenly by 1 and 7.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question that will help you practice recognizing prime numbers. This one will help you review the definition of a prime number and practice identifying numbers that are not prime. Here it is:\n\n**Question:** Which of the following numbers is not a prime number?\n\n**A)** 2\n**B)** 5\n**C)** 8\n**D)** 11\n\n**Correct Answer:** C) 8\n\nThis question will help you solidify your understanding of what makes a number prime and what doesn't. Remember, a prime number is a number that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself.",
