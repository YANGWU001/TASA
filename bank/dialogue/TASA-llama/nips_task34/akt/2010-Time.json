Given their recent practice and low mastery of the concept, I'll create a question that's not too difficult but still challenging enough to help them build their skills.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nTommy has 2 hours to finish his homework. He spends 1 hour 15 minutes on his math problems. How much time does Tommy have left to complete his homework?\n\n**Multiple Choice Options:**\n\nA) 45 minutes\nB) 1 hour 15 minutes\nC) 1 hour 30 minutes\nD) 2 hours\n\n**Why this question?**\n\nThis question assesses the student's understanding of basic time concepts, such as converting between hours and minutes, and subtracting time. The student has just practiced this concept, so the forgetting score is low, and they should be able to recall the necessary information. The question is also self-contained, meaning it doesn't require any external knowledge beyond the Time concept, making it a good starting point for building their understanding.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\nIf the student answers correctly, it will indicate that they have a good grasp of the Time concept and can apply it to simple problems. If they answer incorrectly, it will help identify areas where they need further practice and review.",

You correctly converted 2 hours to minutes (120 minutes) and 1 hour 15 minutes to minutes (75 minutes). Your calculation of 120 - 75 = 45 minutes is also correct. This indicates that you have a good understanding of the concept of converting between hours and minutes and basic subtraction.\n\nHowever, you expressed some uncertainty about your answer. That's completely normal, especially when working with time conversions. To build confidence, let's review the steps together:\n\n1. Convert 2 hours to minutes: 2 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 120 minutes\n2. Convert 1 hour 15 minutes to minutes: 1 hour * 60 minutes per hour = 60 minutes + 15 minutes = 75 minutes\n3. Subtract 75 minutes from 120 minutes: 120 - 75 = 45 minutes\n\nYour answer, **A) 45 minutes**, is indeed correct.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nGiven your current understanding of Time, let's try a question that builds on your skills.

So, the correct conversion for the end time is:\n\n9 hours = 9 * 60 = 540 minutes\nAdding the extra 15 minutes: 540 + 15 = 555 minutes\n\nNow, let's find the difference between the start and end times: 555 - 465 = 90 minutes.\n\nSo, the movie lasts 90 minutes.

You correctly calculated the departure time in minutes: 9 hours 45 minutes = 9 * 60 + 45 = 585 minutes. You also correctly calculated the arrival time in minutes: 12 hours 20 minutes = 12 * 60 + 20 = 740 minutes.\n\nWhen you subtracted the departure time from the arrival time, you got the correct result: 740 minutes - 585 minutes = 155 minutes. This is indeed the total travel time in minutes.\n\nHowever, when converting the travel time back to hours and minutes, you made a slight mistake. You correctly calculated 2 hours as 120 minutes, but then you added 35 minutes to get 155 minutes, which is correct. However, you correctly concluded that this equals 2 hours and 35 minutes.\n\nThe correct answer is indeed 2 hours and 35 minutes. Well done! You're getting better at time conversions and subtraction.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nGiven your current understanding of Time, let's try a question that builds on your skills. Here's a new question:\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nA bakery opens at 7:00 AM and closes at 5:45 PM. What is the total duration of the bakery's operating hours in hours and minutes?\n\n**Multiple Choice Options:**\n\nA) 10 hours 45 minutes\nB) 11 hours 0 minutes\nC) 11 hours 45 minutes\nD) 12 hours 0 minutes\n\n**Why this question?**\n\nThis question requires you to apply your understanding of time conversions and subtraction to find the duration of the bakery's operating hours. You'll need to convert both the opening and closing times to minutes, then subtract the opening time from the closing time. This will help you build your skills in a more practical way.\n\nTake your time, and think through the problem step by step. Remember, you can always ask for help if you're unsure about anything.",
