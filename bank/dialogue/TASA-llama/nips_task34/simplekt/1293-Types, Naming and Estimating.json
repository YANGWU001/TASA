Estimate the volume of the prism.\n\n**What to do:** \n\n1. Round each dimension to the nearest 10.\n2. Use the rounded dimensions to calculate the volume of the prism.\n\n**Show your work and estimate the answer.**\n\nThis question is designed to help the student practice estimating and naming the volume of a rectangular prism, which is a fundamental concept in Types, Naming, and Estimating. By rounding the dimensions to the nearest 10, the student will need to apply their understanding of scale factors to simplify the calculation and estimate the volume. This question is tailored to their current knowledge level, as it requires them to apply basic concepts and build upon their existing understanding.\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n\n- Practice estimating and rounding dimensions\n- Apply scale factors to simplify calculations\n- Calculate the volume of a rectangular prism using the formula V = lwh\n\n**Grading criteria:**\n\n- Does the student correctly round each dimension to the nearest 10?\n- Does the student apply the correct scale factors to simplify the calculation?\n- Does the student calculate the volume using the formula V = lwh?\n\nThis question will help the student assess their understanding of Types, Naming, and Estimating, and provide a foundation for further learning and improvement.",

However, there is an error in their approach. When rounding the width and height to 0 cm, they are essentially setting the width and height to zero, which would result in a volume of 0 cm\u00b3. However, this is not the correct approach to estimating volume using the given dimensions.\n\nA more accurate approach would be to round the dimensions to the nearest 10, which would result in 10 cm for the length and 10 cm for both the width and the height (since 4 cm is closer to 10 than to 0). This would give a volume of 10 cm * 10 cm * 10 cm = 1000 cm\u00b3.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question:** \n\nA rectangular prism has a length of 12 cm, a width of 9 cm, and a height of 5 cm.

However, there is an error in their approach. When rounding the width and height to 10 cm, they are correct. However, they rounded the height to 10 cm incorrectly. A more accurate approach would be to round the dimensions to the nearest 10, which would result in 10 cm for the length, 10 cm for the width, and 0 cm for the height (since 6 cm is closer to 10 than to 0, but 3 cm is closer to 0 than to 10). However, they chose to round 6 cm to 10 cm, but actually 6 cm is closer to 10 cm, the correct rounding for 9 cm would be 10 cm, and the correct rounding for 6 cm would be 0 cm, since 6 cm is closer to 0 than to 10.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question:**\n\nA rectangular prism has a length of 7 cm, a width of 1 cm, and a height of 8 cm.
