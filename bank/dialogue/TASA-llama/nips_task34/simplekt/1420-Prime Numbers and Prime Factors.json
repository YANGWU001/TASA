This option is partially correct in that a prime number is indeed divisible by itself, but it's incomplete. A prime number is also divisible by 1, not just 2. The correct definition of a prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself. For example, the number 5 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 5.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help solidify your understanding of prime numbers, let's try another question.

The prime factorization of 6 involves breaking it down into its prime factors, which are numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. In this case, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3, not 4 and 1. Remember, 4 is a composite number, not a prime number. The correct prime factorization of 6 is actually **A) 2 \u00d7 3**, as 2 and 3 are both prime numbers and can only be divided by 1 and themselves.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build your understanding of prime numbers and prime factorization.
