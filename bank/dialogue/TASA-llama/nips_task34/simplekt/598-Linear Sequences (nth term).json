Given the values of a = 3 and d = 2, the student should be able to find the 5th term by substituting n = 5 into the formula: a_5 = 3 + (5-1)2 = 3 + 4*2 = 11.\n\nThis question is a good starting point because it:\n\n1. Requires the student to recall the formula for the nth term.\n2. Involves a simple calculation that doesn't require complex problem-solving.\n3. Allows the student to focus on applying the formula without being overwhelmed by more complex information.\n\nBy solving this question, the student will be able to demonstrate their understanding of the concept and begin rebuilding their confidence in Linear Sequences (nth term).",
