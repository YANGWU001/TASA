Review and reinforce basic concepts of BIDMAS.\n2.  Gradually increase the difficulty level to help the student regain confidence.\n3.  Assess their understanding and identify areas for improvement.\n\nHere's a question to get started:\n\n**Question:**\n\nSolve the expression: 3 \u00d7 2 + 12 \u00f7 4 - 8\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n\nThis question assesses the student's ability to apply the order of operations (BIDMAS) in a simple scenario. The student is expected to follow the correct order of operations, which is:\n\n1.  Division (12 \u00f7 4 = 3)\n2.  Multiplication (3 \u00d7 3 = 9)\n3.  Addition and Subtraction (9 + 3 - 8 = 4)\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n- It's a basic application of BIDMAS, which is within the student's current knowledge level.\n- It involves a mix of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), which will help the student practice applying the order of operations in a real-world scenario.\n- The question is relatively straightforward, allowing the student to regain confidence and build their understanding before moving on to more complex problems.\n\n**Grading and feedback:**\n\n- If the student answers correctly, provide positive reinforcement and encouragement to build their confidence.\n- If the student answers incorrectly, provide clear explanations and examples to help them understand the correct order of operations and the solution to the problem.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n- If the student answers correctly, proceed to more challenging questions that gradually increase in difficulty.\n- If the student struggles, provide additional practice exercises and review sessions to reinforce their understanding of BIDMAS before moving on to more complex concepts.",

You correctly calculated the multiplication and division parts:\n\n- 3 \u00d7 2 = 6\n- 12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\nBut when you added and subtracted in the order they appeared, you should have followed the correct order of operations. Since the division was calculated first, the correct order should be:\n\n- 6 + 3 = 9\n- 9 - 8 = 1\n\nHowever, you added 3 to 6 first and then subtracted 8 from the result of that addition, which is not the correct order. The correct answer is indeed 1, but the reasoning behind it is a bit off.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build your confidence in applying the order of operations. Here it is:\n\nSolve the expression: 18 \u00f7 3 + 5 - 2\n\nThis question is similar to the previous one, but with a slight twist. It involves division and addition/subtraction, and you'll need to apply the correct order of operations to get the right answer. Take your time, and remember to follow the BIDMAS rule:\n\n1.
