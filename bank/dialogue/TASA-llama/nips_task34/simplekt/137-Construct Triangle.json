Use a protractor to draw a 60\u00b0 angle at the bottom left vertex. Then, draw a line from the top vertex to the bottom right vertex to complete the triangle.

In a right-angled triangle with a 60\u00b0 angle, the side opposite the 60\u00b0 angle is actually the side adjacent to the 30\u00b0 angle (since the other angle must be 30\u00b0 for a right-angled triangle). This side is in the ratio 1:\u221a3:2 with the hypotenuse and the side adjacent to the 90\u00b0 angle, respectively.

The sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is always 180\u00b0. If one angle is 45\u00b0, we can find the sum of the other two angles by subtracting the known angle from 180\u00b0. In this case, 180\u00b0 - 45\u00b0 = 135\u00b0. Therefore, the sum of the other two angles is 135\u00b0, not 90\u00b0.

The sum of the measures of the angles in a triangle is always 180\u00b0. We know two of the angles measure 70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0, so we can find the measure of the third angle by subtracting the sum of the known angles from 180\u00b0. In this case, 70\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 = 150\u00b0. Therefore, the measure of the third angle is 180\u00b0 - 150\u00b0 = 30\u00b0.

The student's reasoning is close, as they correctly recall that the total sum of the angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0 and attempts to subtract a portion of that total from 180\u00b0. However, the student mistakenly assumes that the remaining angles would be 60\u00b0 each, rather than calculating the correct measure. To find the measure of the other two angles, the student should subtract the known angle (50\u00b0) from 180\u00b0, which results in 130\u00b0.
