To solve the inequality 2x + 5 > 11, you correctly subtracted 5 from both sides to get 2x > 6, and then divided both sides by 2 to get x > 3. However, the original question had 11 on the right side, not 3. Since 11 - 5 is indeed 6, your process was correct, but the initial subtraction step should have resulted in 2x > 6, and the final division should have given you x > 3, not x > 2. Well done on getting the direction of the inequality sign right, though!\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nNow, let's try another question that builds upon your understanding of solving linear inequalities.

      "content": "**Explanation of Last Answer:**\n\nYou were unsure about how to solve the inequality 2x + 5 \u2265 11. That's completely okay! Let's break it down together. To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the inequality. Our first step is to subtract 5 from both sides of the inequality, which gives us 2x \u2265 11 - 5. Simplifying the right side, we get 2x \u2265 6. Next, we want to get x by itself, so we divide both sides by 2. Since we're dividing by a positive number, the direction of the inequality sign remains the same. So, we get x \u2265 6/2, which simplifies to x \u2265 3. However, none of the answer choices match this solution.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question that's similar to the previous ones, but with a slight twist. Here it is:\n\nSolve the inequality:\n\n3x - 2 \u2264 7\n\nA) x \u2264 3\nB) x \u2265 3\nC) x < 3\nD) x > 3\n\nThis question requires you to isolate the variable (x) and understand the direction of the inequality sign. You'll need to perform basic algebraic operations (addition and division) to solve for x. Take your time, and remember to check your work carefully.\n\nNote: This question requires adding 2 to both sides and then dividing by 3, which should help solidify your understanding of maintaining the correct inequality sign direction when performing these operations.",
