By providing a multiple-choice question with four options, I'm allowing the student to apply their knowledge and think critically. The correct answer, B) 2, 3, 6, 12, will help reinforce their understanding of factors and set the stage for the concept of HCF.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* The question is straightforward and easy to understand, allowing the student to demonstrate their current knowledge level.\n* The options are carefully crafted to ensure that the student must think critically and apply their understanding of factors to arrive at the correct answer.\n* By providing a multiple-choice question, I'm giving the student an opportunity to practice and build their confidence in identifying factors.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\nIf the student answers this question correctly, I'll provide additional practice questions that build on their understanding of factors and HCF. If they struggle, I'll provide more guidance and explanations to help solidify their understanding of the concept.",

They also included 24 and 36, which are not factors of 36.\n\n**Encouragement:**\n\nDon't worry, you're close! Finding factors can be a bit tricky, but you're getting closer to mastering it. Remember, factors are numbers that can multiply together to make the original number. Let's review the correct factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nFind the HCF of 30 and 45.\n\nA) 1\nB) 3\nC) 5\nD) 15\n\n**Why this question:**\n\nThis question will help you practice finding the HCF of two numbers, which is a crucial concept in math. By providing a multiple-choice question with four options, I'm allowing you to practice and think critically about the concept. The correct answer will help reinforce your understanding of HCF and factors.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* The question requires you to apply your knowledge of factors to find the HCF of two numbers.\n* The options are carefully crafted to ensure that you must think critically and apply your understanding of factors and HCF to arrive at the correct answer.\n* By providing a multiple-choice question, I'm giving you an opportunity to practice and build your confidence in identifying the HCF.",
