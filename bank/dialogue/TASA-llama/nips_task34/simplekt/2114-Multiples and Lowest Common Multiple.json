Although the student correctly listed the multiples of 4 and 9, they incorrectly identified 12 as the lowest common multiple. The student's reasoning was partially correct, noticing that 12 appears in both lists of multiples. However, they should have considered that 12 is not the first number that appears in both lists; 36 is the first number that appears in both lists (multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, \u2026 and multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, \u2026).
