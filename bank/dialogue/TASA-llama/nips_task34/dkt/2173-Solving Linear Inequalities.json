Here's a practice question for the student:\n\n**Question:** \n\nSolve the inequality: 2x + 5 > 11\n\n**Task:** Find the solution set for x.\n\n**Hint:** Start by isolating the variable x.\n\nThis question is designed to assess the student's understanding of:\n\n1.  Adding or subtracting the same value to both sides of an inequality\n2. Isolating the variable x in a linear inequality\n3. Writing the solution set in interval notation (though not explicitly required, it's a bonus)\n\nThe student's current mastery level of 43% suggests they have a basic understanding of solving linear inequalities, but struggle with more complex or nuanced concepts. This question should challenge them to apply their existing knowledge to a relatively straightforward problem, allowing them to build confidence and solidify their understanding of the concept.\n\n**Adjustments for the student's performance:**\n\n* Given the student's recent performance of 0% on 5 attempts, the question is designed to be a bit more straightforward, with a clear and simple operation required to solve the inequality.\n* The student's modest mastery level indicates they may struggle with more complex inequalities, so I've chosen a relatively simple one to start with.\n* The question doesn't require the student to solve for multiple variables or use more advanced techniques, allowing them to focus on the core concept of isolating the variable x.",
