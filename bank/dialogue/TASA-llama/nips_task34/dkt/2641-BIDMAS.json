Your steps are mostly correct: you correctly evaluated the expression inside the parentheses, 2 + 5 = 7, and then multiplied 7 by 3 to get 21. However, you then proceeded to evaluate the expression in a somewhat confusing order. You correctly identified the need to subtract 21 from 6, but incorrectly considered an alternative order of operations that would involve subtracting 7 from 6 first. Fortunately, your alternative solution, subtracting 7 from 6 and then multiplying by 3, is mathematically equivalent to the correct order of operations. Your answer of -3 is actually correct, but it's great that you're thinking critically about the order of operations and considering alternative solutions.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question:** Simplify the expression: 12 - 4 \u00d7 (3 - 2)\n\n**Expected Answer:** 1.
