      "content": "**Student's Last Answer Analysis:**\n\nUnfortunately, your answer, B) 216, is **INCORRECT.** Although you correctly listed some multiples of 27 and 32, you missed the fact that 288 is a common multiple of both numbers. To find the LCM, you should have looked for the smallest number that appears in both lists of multiples. In this case, 288 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 27 and 32. You can see that 288 appears in the list of multiples of 32, but it's not in the list of multiples of 27 that you provided. Let's try to find it by listing a few more multiples of 27: 27, 54, 81, 108, 135, 162, 189, 216, 243, 270, 297, 324, 351, 378, 405, 432, 459, 486, 513, 540, 567, 594, 621, 648, 675, 702, 729, 756, 783, 810, 837, 864. \n\nNow, you can see that 288 is indeed a multiple of 27 (27 \u00d7 10.67 = 288) and 32 (32 \u00d7 9 = 288). This means that 288 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both 27 and 32, making it the LCM.\n\n**Encouragement and Feedback:**\n\nDon't worry, it's okay to make mistakes! You're still demonstrating a good understanding of the concept, and you're close to getting it right.
