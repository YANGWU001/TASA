The student is likely familiar with the concept of factors, but may struggle to recall them for a specific number. By choosing the correct answer, the student will demonstrate their ability to identify the factors of a given number. This will also help identify any misconceptions or gaps in their knowledge.\n\n**Why not a more challenging question?**\n\nGiven the student's low mastery level, it's essential to start with a question that is not too complex or challenging. A more difficult question might overwhelm the student and lead to frustration. By starting with a basic question, we can build their confidence and gradually increase the difficulty level as they become more comfortable with the concept.\n\n**What to look for in the student's response:**\n\n* Does the student correctly identify the factors of 12?\n* Are there any obvious misconceptions or gaps in their understanding?\n* Can the student explain why they chose a particular answer?\n\nThis question will provide a solid foundation for further practice and assessment, and will help us identify areas where the student needs additional support.",
