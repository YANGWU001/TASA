The student has shown a low mastery of prime numbers and prime factors, so the question is designed to assess their understanding of prime factorization.\n2.  The number 12 is a relatively small number, making it easier for the student to work with.\n3.  The answer options include a correct and incorrect prime factorization, as well as a non-prime factorization (1 \u00d7 12), to help the student understand the concept of prime factors.\n4.  This question requires the student to apply their knowledge of prime numbers and prime factors to solve the problem, rather than simply recalling a definition.\n\n**Expected learning outcome:**\n\nBy answering this question correctly, the student will demonstrate their understanding of prime factorization and prime numbers.
