If he spends 45 minutes on math problems and 30 minutes on reading, how much time does he have left to play video games?\n\n**A)** 1 hour and 15 minutes\n**B)** 1 hour and 30 minutes\n**C)** 1 hour and 45 minutes\n**D)** 2 hours\n\nThis question assesses the student's understanding of time and allows them to apply their knowledge to a simple, real-world scenario. The time intervals are relatively manageable, and the question doesn't require the student to recall large numbers or complex calculations.

You correctly converted 3 hours to minutes (180 minutes) and identified the total time spent on math and reading (75 minutes). However, your subtraction calculation was a bit off. Let's break it down together: 180 minutes (total time) - 75 minutes (time spent on math and reading) = 105 minutes. That's correct! Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 105 minutes is indeed equivalent to 1 hour and 45 minutes.

The correct answer is **D) 6:00 PM**.\n\n**The Next Question:**\n\nYou're making great progress, and I'm confident you'll master Time concepts soon.
