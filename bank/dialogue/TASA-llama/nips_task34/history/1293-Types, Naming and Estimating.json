Your initial guess of 0.5 is close, but it seems you forgot to divide by 100 due to the exponent being negative 2. Don't worry, though - you're on the right track!\n\n**Next Question**\n\nTo help you build your confidence and practice converting between scientific and standard notation, here's your next question, which focuses on a slightly different coefficient:\n\n**Question 5:** What is the approximate value of 3.75 \u00d7 10^(-1) in standard notation?\n\nTake your time, and remember that you can ask for help or clarification at any point. I'll be here to guide you through it.\n\n(Note: This question is designed to help you apply the concept of moving the decimal point when the exponent is negative, and it also involves a slightly larger coefficient to help you practice with a more complex number.)",
