You correctly added 2 to both sides to get rid of the +2 term, resulting in 4x < 16.

When you divide both sides by a positive number, the inequality sign remains the same. Since 16 is not equal to 16, the solution is an open interval, and the correct answer is B) x \u2264 4.\n\nThe reason it's \"less than or equal to\" is that the inequality 4x < 16 implies that x can take any value less than 4, including 4 itself, but not 4 itself.
