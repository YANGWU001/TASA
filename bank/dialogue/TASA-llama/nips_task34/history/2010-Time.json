To convert 240 minutes to hours, we need to divide 240 by 60, which is the same as multiplying 240 by 1/60 or 0.0167 (or simply dividing 240 by 60). This calculation gives us 4 hours. The correct answer is **D) 4 hours**.\n\nTo understand why you answered 2 hours, let's think about the calculation together.

You correctly identified that 45 minutes is equivalent to half an hour, and you multiplied that by 3 assignments to get a total of 1.5 hours. However, you chose the option that said 1 hour, which is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is **C) 1.5 hours**, because 45 minutes is equivalent to 0.75 hours (45 \u00f7 60 = 0.75), and when you multiply that by 3, you get 2.25 hours, but since the options only go up to 1.5 hours, the closest correct answer is indeed 1.5 hours. You showed great effort in breaking down the problem into smaller parts and using your understanding of converting minutes to hours, but you need to be more precise in your calculations.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nLet's try another question that builds on your understanding of converting minutes to hours. This time, we'll practice converting a specific number of minutes to hours and then calculating the total time for multiple events. Remember, you can divide minutes by 60 to find the equivalent number of hours.\n\nQuestion: If a concert lasts for 75 minutes, and there are two intermissions that last 10 minutes each, how many hours will the concert and intermissions last in total?\n\nA) 2 hours\nB) 2.25 hours\nC) 2.5 hours\nD) 3 hours\n\nTake your time, and think about it carefully.

You correctly broke down the problem into smaller parts by converting the concert duration and intermission duration from minutes to hours. You found that the concert lasts for approximately 1.25 hours and the intermissions last for 0.33 hours each. When you added these together, you got approximately 1.58 hours. However, you were asked to choose the closest option from the given choices. \n\nSince 1.58 hours is closer to 1.5 hours than to 2.25 hours, the correct answer should have been **C) 2 hours**.
