I put a little point at the left end and called it **A**, and the right end I called **B**.\n\n2. Then I tried to draw the second side. I think I need to make a line that\u2019s **9\u202fcm** long and attach it to point **A**. So I put the ruler\u2019s zero mark on A, made a rough angle, and drew a line that looks about 9\u202fcm. I labeled the far end of that line **C**.\n\n3. Now for the angle\u2026 I\u2019m not really sure how to do it, but I think I have to use the protractor with the base being AB. I put the protractor\u2019s centre hole on point\u202fA, lined the base up with AB, and then I measured an angle of **60\u00b0** between AB and AC.
