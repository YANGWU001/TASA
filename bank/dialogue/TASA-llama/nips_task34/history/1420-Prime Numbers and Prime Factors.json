Since we didn't get a chance to discuss the previous question, let's review what we've covered so far.\n\n**Prime Numbers and Prime Factors** are crucial concepts in mathematics. A **prime number** is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. For example, the number 5 is prime because the only numbers you can divide it by are 1 and 5. On the other hand, a composite number is a number that has more than two factors. For instance, the number 6 is composite because it can be divided by 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n\nNow, let's practice finding **prime factors**. The prime factors of a number are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. For example, the prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3 because 2 \u00d7 3 = 6.\n\n**Here's your next question:**\n\nWhat are the prime factors of the number 10?",

While 2 is indeed a prime factor of 10, 10 itself is not a prime factor. As we discussed earlier, a prime number is a number that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Since 10 can be divided by 1, 2, 5, and 10, it's a composite number and not a prime factor.\n\nHowever, you're on the right track by identifying 2 as a prime factor of 10. This is because 2 is a prime number and can divide 10 evenly.\n\n**Let's Move Forward**\n\nTo find the prime factors of 10, we need to think about what prime numbers multiply together to give 10. We already know that 2 is a factor, so let's try dividing 10 by 2: 10 \u00f7 2 = 5. And 5 is also a prime number.

To clarify, a prime number is a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself. In the case of 17, it can only be divided by 1 and 17, and both of these are prime numbers. So, the prime factors of 17 are indeed 1 and 17. Remember, when listing prime factors, we usually focus on the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. For a prime number like 17, its only prime factor is itself, but it's common to include 1 as a factor as well.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nTo help you build on this concept, let's try a question that's similar to the previous ones. Here it is:\n\nWhat are the prime factors of the number 19?",
