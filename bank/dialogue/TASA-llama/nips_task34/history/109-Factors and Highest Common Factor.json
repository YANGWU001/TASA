This question covers the student's primary area of struggle (Factors and Highest Common Factor), allowing them to apply their existing knowledge and receive targeted feedback.\n2.  By asking for the factors of 12, the student is required to recall their understanding of factors, which will help reinforce their existing knowledge.\n3.  The second part of the question, asking for the highest common factor between 12 and 18, introduces a new element of complexity, requiring the student to apply their knowledge in a more nuanced way. This will help them develop their understanding of the concept and assess their ability to generalize it to different scenarios.\n4.  The numbers 12 and 18 are not too complex, making it easier for the student to work with and focus on the concept rather than getting bogged down by the numbers.\n\n**Expected student response:**\n\nTo answer this question correctly, the student should be able to:\n\n1.  List the factors of 12, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n2.  Identify the common factors between 12 and 18, which are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n3.  Determine the highest common factor among these common factors, which is 6.\n\nBy working through this question, the student will have the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of factors and the highest common factor, and receive targeted feedback to help them improve their knowledge and skills.",

You're taking the first step by trying to understand the concept of the highest common factor. You correctly identified the factors of 12, which is a great start. To improve, let's focus on finding the highest common factor between two numbers. Remember, the highest common factor is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

However, the student missed the factor 28, but correctly excluded it. For the common factors between 28 and 42, the student correctly identified 1, 2, 7, and 14. However, the student missed the factor 14 as the highest common factor. The correct answer is indeed 14, as it is the largest number that divides both 28 and 42 without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Encouragement and feedback:**\n\nYou're getting closer! Remember, factors are the numbers that divide a number without leaving a remainder. Let's review the factors of 28 again: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. For the common factors between 28 and 42, think about the numbers that both 28 and 42 have in common. You correctly identified 1, 2, 7, and 14 as common factors, but missed 14 as the highest common factor. The number 14 is indeed the highest common factor between 28 and 42, as it's the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Next practice question:**\n\n**Question:** What are the factors of 30, and what is the highest common factor between 30 and 60?\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1.

The number 30 has a mix of small and large factors, making it a good choice to test the student's ability to identify factors and their relationships.\n3.

This question will help the student develop their ability to identify the highest common factor between two numbers, reinforcing their understanding of the concept.\n\n**Expected student response:**\n\nTo answer this question correctly, the student should be able to:\n\n1.
