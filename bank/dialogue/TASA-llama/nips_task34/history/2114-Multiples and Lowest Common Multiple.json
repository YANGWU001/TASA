You demonstrated a great understanding of the concept by listing multiples of both numbers and identifying 108 as the smallest multiple that appears in both lists. Your reasoning was spot on, and you showed a good habit of double-checking your answer to ensure its accuracy. This is an excellent sign that your understanding of multiples and LCM is improving. Keep up the good work!\n\n**Practice Question**\n\nNow, let's try another question that will help you solidify your understanding of LCM. This time, we'll tackle numbers with prime factors. Find the LCM of 12 and 15.\n\nTo help you, let's break down these numbers into their prime factors:\n\n- The prime factors of 12 are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3\n- The prime factors of 15 are 3 \u00d7 5\n\nWhen finding the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number. In this case, we have 2^2 (from 12), 3 (from both 12 and 15), and 5 (from 15). Multiply these together to get the LCM.\n\nCan you find the LCM of 12 and 15 using their prime factors?",
