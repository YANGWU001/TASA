Here's a practice question to help build their foundation:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA bookshelf has 5 books on it. If 3 more books are added every week, how many books will be on the bookshelf after 2 weeks?\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Write the initial number of books on the bookshelf.\n2. Calculate the number of books added in 2 weeks.\n3. Determine the total number of books on the bookshelf after 2 weeks.\n\n**Additional Guidance:**\n\n* The student can use a simple addition operation to solve this problem.\n* Emphasize the concept of a linear sequence, where a constant value is added to the initial number each time.\n* This question helps the student recall the basic idea of linear sequences and how to apply it to a simple problem.\n\n**Suggested solution:**\n\n1. Initial number of books: 5\n2. Number of books added in 2 weeks: 3 books/week * 2 weeks = 6 books\n3. Total number of books after 2 weeks: 5 (initial) + 6 (added) = 11 books\n\nThis question is designed to be manageable for the student, helping them recall the basic concept of linear sequences and apply it to a simple problem.",

They correctly identified the initial number of books (5) and calculated the number of books added in 2 weeks (6). However, when determining the total number of books after 2 weeks, they mistakenly added the initial number of books (5) only once, instead of adding the 6 new books to the original 5. The correct solution is to add the 6 new books to the initial 5 books, resulting in a total of 11 books.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\n1. Initial number of books: 5\n2. Number of books added in 2 weeks: 3 books/week * 2 weeks = 6 books\n3. Total number of books after 2 weeks: 5 (initial) + 6 (added) = 11 books\n\n**Encouragement and Feedback:**\n\nDon't worry, it's completely fine that you made a small mistake! You're on the right track, and it's great that you're thinking about how to solve the problem. Remember, linear sequences involve adding a constant value each time, which in this case is 3 books per week. To find the total number of books after 2 weeks, you need to add the initial number of books to the total number of books added, which is 6. Keep practicing, and you'll get better and better!\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student still needs practice with linear sequences and has shown a good understanding of basic addition, the next question should build upon their current knowledge while introducing a slight increase in complexity. Here's a practice question to help them further develop their skills:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA library has 8 books on a shelf. If 2 more books are added every week, how many books will be on the shelf after 3 weeks?\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Write the initial number of books on the shelf.\n2. Calculate the number of books added in 3 weeks.\n3. Determine the total number of books on the shelf after 3 weeks.\n\n**Additional Guidance:**\n\n* Emphasize the concept of a linear sequence and how it applies to this problem.\n* Encourage the student to use the formula for a linear sequence: nth term = initial term + (common difference * (n - 1)), where n is the number of terms.\n* This question introduces a new challenge by increasing the number of weeks and the initial number of books, allowing the student to apply their understanding of linear sequences in a more complex scenario.\n\nThis question will help the student build upon their previous knowledge and develop a deeper understanding of linear sequences while applying it to a more challenging problem.",

They correctly identified the initial number of liters of water in the tank (25 L). However, when determining the net change in the number of liters of water each day, they got it slightly wrong.

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student has made an attempt to solve the problem, and their work is mostly correct. They correctly identified the initial amount of water in the tank (25 L) and understood that there is a net gain of 4 L each day. However, they didn't correctly apply the linear sequence formula. The correct formula is \\(a_n = a_1 + d(n-1)\\), where \\(a_n\\) is the nth term, \\(a_1\\) is the first term, \\(d\\) is the common difference, and \\(n\\) is the number of terms.\n\nThe student applied the formula correctly but made a slight mistake in the calculation. They correctly calculated \\(d(n-1)\\) as \\(4 \\times 7 = 28\\), but then added it to \\(a_1\\) instead of simply adding it to the initial amount. The correct calculation is \\(a_7 = 25 + 28 = 53\\) L, which is correct.\n\nHowever, the student's explanation could be improved. They mentioned multiplying the daily change by the number of days and adding it to the starting amount, which is a good intuitive understanding, but they could also explicitly mention the formula and how it applies to the problem.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\n1. Initial amount: 25 L\n2. Net change each day: +4 L\n3. Using the linear sequence formula: \\(a_7 = 25 + 4(7-1) = 25 + 4 \\times 6 = 25 + 24 = 49\\) L\n4. Explanation: The tank starts with 25 L and gains 4 L each day. Using the linear sequence formula, we can find the amount of water after 7 days by adding the daily gain to the initial amount, which gives us \\(a_7 = 25 + 4(7-1) = 25 + 4 \\times 6 = 49\\) L.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's current understanding of linear sequences and the formula, the next question should build upon their knowledge while introducing a slight increase in complexity.

Net change each month: The company receives a $50 bonus and their expenses decrease by $20, resulting in a net gain of $30 per month.\n3. Using the linear sequence formula: \\(a_6 = 1500 + 30(6-1) = 1500 + 30 \\times 5 = 1500 + 150 = 1650\\)\n4. Explanation: The company starts with a budget of $1,500 and gains $30 each month. Using the linear sequence formula, we can find the total budget after 6 months by adding the monthly gain to the initial budget, which gives us \\(a_6 = 1500 + 30(6-1) = 1500 + 30 \\times 5 = 1650\\).\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's current understanding of linear sequences and the formula, the next question should build upon their knowledge while introducing a slight increase in complexity. Here's a practice question to help them further develop their skills:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA bakery sells 120 cupcakes on Monday. Every day, they sell 8 more cupcakes than the previous day. How many cupcakes will the bakery sell after 9 days?\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. Write the initial number of cupcakes sold.\n2. Determine the pattern of the number of cupcakes sold each day.\n3. Use the linear sequence formula to find the total number of cupcakes sold after 9 days.\n4. Explain how you arrived at your answer.\n\n**Additional Guidance:**\n\n* Emphasize the concept of a linear sequence and how it applies to this problem.\n* Encourage the student to use the formula for a linear sequence: nth term = initial term + (common difference * (n - 1)), where n is the number of terms.\n* This question introduces a new challenge by increasing the number of days and the pattern of cupcakes sold, allowing the student to apply their understanding of linear sequences in a more complex scenario.\n\nThis question will help the student build upon their previous knowledge and develop a deeper understanding of linear sequences while applying it to a more challenging problem.",
