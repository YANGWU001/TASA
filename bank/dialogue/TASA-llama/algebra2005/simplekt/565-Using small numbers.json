It seems that you might have relied on a rough estimate or a guess, rather than using a specific multiplication strategy. In our previous conversations, we discussed how multiplying by 6 can be thought of as adding 6 together a certain number of times. This time, you could have used the strategy of breaking down 4 into 6 + 6 + 6, and then multiplying each 6 by 6, which would be 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, and then adding those results together: 18 + 18 = 36. However, it seems that you didn't use this strategy this time.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nGiven your current knowledge state and recent learning events, the next question is designed to help you build on your understanding of using small numbers and address any areas where you need improvement.\n\nHere's your next practice question:\n\n**Question:** What is the value of 2 \u00d7 9?\n\n**Reasoning Skill:** This question assesses your ability to multiply small numbers, similar to the previous questions. However, this time, you'll be multiplying 2 by 9, which requires a different mental math strategy.\n\n**Helpful Hint:** To support you, I'll provide a hint that builds on the previous ones: \"Remember, 9 is a big number, but you can think of it as 10 - 1. So, 2 \u00d7 9 can be thought of as 2 \u00d7 (10 - 1). Can you use this to help you multiply 2 by 9?\"\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1.  Reinforce your existing knowledge of small number multiplication\n2.  Help you build confidence in your ability to apply this concept to different numbers\n3.
