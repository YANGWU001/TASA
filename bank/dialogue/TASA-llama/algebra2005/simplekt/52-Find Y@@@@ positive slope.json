The student has shown difficulty with finding the y-intercept (Y) for a positive slope, so I'm providing a simpler scenario with a given point (0, 3), which is the y-intercept itself.\n2.  The second point (2, 5) has a positive x-coordinate, indicating a positive slope, but the y-coordinate is not the focus here. This will help the student understand the concept of a y-intercept without getting bogged down by slope calculations.\n3.  The question requires the student to recall the definition of a y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, and the y-coordinate of that point is the answer.\n\n**Expected answer:**\n\nThe y-intercept (Y) is 3.\n\nThis question should help the student build confidence and reinforce their understanding of the y-intercept concept, which is a fundamental aspect of finding the y-intercept for a positive slope.",
