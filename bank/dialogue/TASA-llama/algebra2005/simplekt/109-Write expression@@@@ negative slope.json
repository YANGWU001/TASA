It directly targets the concept of writing expressions for a negative slope, which the student needs improvement on.\n2.  The negative slope is given as a simple integer (-3), making it easier for the student to focus on the concept rather than getting bogged down by complex numbers.\n3.  The question format (multiple-choice) allows the student to choose from a set of options, reducing the risk of overwhelming them with a blank space to fill in.\n4.  The correct answer (y = -3x - 2) is a straightforward representation of a line with a negative slope, making it a good starting point for the student to build their understanding.\n\n**Expected learning outcome:**\n\nBy answering this question correctly, the student will:\n\n1.  Understand the relationship between the slope and the expression in the form y = mx + b.\n2.  Recognize that a negative slope is represented by a negative coefficient (in this case, -3) in front of the x term.\n3.

The negative slope of -3 should be represented by a negative coefficient (-3) in front of the x term, not a positive coefficient (3). The student correctly identified the slope as -3, but incorrectly placed the negative sign. A negative slope indicates a downward direction, which means the y-value decreases as x increases. In the expression y = mx + b, a negative slope (m) should be represented by a negative value, hence the correct answer is y = -3x - 2.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student still struggles with writing expressions for a negative slope, the next question will focus on breaking down the concept further and providing more support.

When reflecting a line over the x-axis, the slope changes sign, which means the positive slope of 2 becomes a negative slope. This is because reflecting a line over the x-axis is equivalent to changing the sign of the slope. The student needs to understand that reflecting a line over the x-axis inverts the line, changing the direction of the slope.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student still struggles with understanding the relationship between a positive and negative slope and converting a positive slope to a negative slope, the next question will focus on providing a visual representation of a line with a positive slope and asking them to identify the negative slope after a specific transformation.\n\n**Question:**\n\nLook at the graph below:\n\n\n\nThe line has a positive slope of 4. If we were to reflect the line over the y-axis, what would be the slope of the new line?\n\n**A)** -4\n**B)** 4\n**C)** 8\n**D)** -8\n\n**Correct answer:** A) -4\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1.  It targets the concept of converting a positive slope to a negative slope, which the student needs to understand.\n2.  The graph provides a visual representation of the line, making it easier for the student to understand the concept of reflecting a line over the y-axis.\n3.  The question format (multiple-choice) allows the student to choose from a set of options, reducing the risk of overwhelming them with a blank space to fill in.\n4.  The correct answer (-4) is a straightforward representation of the negative slope, making it a good next step for the student to build their understanding.\n\n**Expected learning outcome:**\n\nBy answering this question correctly, the student will:\n\n1.  Understand the relationship between a positive and negative slope.\n2.  Learn how to convert a positive slope to a negative slope by reflecting a line over the y-axis.\n3.
