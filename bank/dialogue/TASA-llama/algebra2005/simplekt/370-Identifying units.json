If he gives 2 pencils to his friend, how many pencils will Tom have left?\n\n**A)** 3\n**B)** 5\n**C)** 7\n**D)** 10\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis question requires the student to identify the unit of measurement (pencils) and understand the concept of subtraction. By giving 2 pencils to his friend, Tom will have fewer pencils left. The correct answer is 3 (5 - 2 = 3).\n\n**Why this question:**\nThis question is a simple, real-world scenario that requires the student to apply their understanding of units and basic arithmetic operations. The answer choices are straightforward, making it easy for the student to identify the correct unit of measurement and perform the subtraction.",

You correctly identified the concept of multiplication as the operation needed to find the total number of books the bookshelf can hold. However, when multiplying, we need to multiply the number of shelves (3) by the number of books on each shelf (4). This is a simple multiplication problem: 3 \u00d7 4 = 12. So, the bookshelf can hold a total of 12 books.\n\n**Why it's incorrect:** You're close, but you need to multiply the numbers correctly. Remember, when we multiply, we need to count how many groups of objects we have and multiply the number of objects in each group by the number of groups.
