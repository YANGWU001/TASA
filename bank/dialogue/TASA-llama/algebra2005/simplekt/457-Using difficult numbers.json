The question should assess their understanding and help build their confidence.\n\nHere's the first practice question:\n\nQuestion:  756 \u00f7 9 = ?\n\nThis question requires the student to divide a two-digit number by a single-digit number, which is a relatively simple operation. However, the result will be a decimal, which might be challenging for the student. This question will help assess their ability to perform division with difficult numbers and may help them build their confidence in this area.\n\nAnswer: 84",

      "content": "**Review of the Student's Last Answer**\n\nYour answer, 115, is incorrect. You attempted to divide 720 by 6, but your calculation seems to have gone off track. You correctly identified that 6 goes into 72 about 12 times, but when you tried to bring down the zero, you added an extra \"5\" to the end of the quotient, resulting in 115. However, this is not the correct approach when dividing by 6. When you bring down the zero, you should consider it as 0 groups of 6, not adding an extra digit to the quotient.\n\nLet's break it down: 6 goes into 72 exactly 12 times, leaving us with 0. Since 720 is a multiple of 6 (6 \u00d7 120 = 720), the correct answer is indeed 120.\n\nDon't worry, mistakes are an essential part of the learning process. You demonstrated a good understanding of the division algorithm, but there's room for improvement in handling the last digit. With a bit more practice, you'll become more accurate.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nQuestion: 630 \u00f7 5 = ?\n\nThis question requires you to divide a two-digit number by a single-digit number. Try using the division algorithm or estimate the answer by thinking about how many groups of 5 can fit into 630. Take your time, and see if you can get the correct answer.

You demonstrated a great understanding of the division algorithm by estimating the answer and then applying it to find the exact quotient. Your thought process was clear, and you correctly determined that 5 can fit into 630 exactly 126 times, with a remainder of 0. This shows that you're making progress in understanding how to divide numbers.\n\nHowever, it's essential to remember that when estimating, it's crucial to double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy. In this case, you correctly estimated that 5 can fit into 630 about 124 times, but then you confirmed the exact quotient, which is indeed 126. This is a great example of how to use estimation as a tool to check your work.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nQuestion: 945 \u00f7 9 = ?\n\nThis question requires you to divide a two-digit number by a single-digit number.

Although you demonstrated a good approach by estimating that 9 can fit into 945 about 100 times, you made a small mistake when adding extra groups of 9 to account for the remainder. You added 6 groups of 9, but that's actually more than the remainder of 45 can support. To find the correct number of extra groups, you can divide the remainder by 9, which is 45 \u00f7 9 = 5. So, you should add 5 more groups of 9 to your initial estimate of 100 groups. This gives you a total of 105 groups of 9. Therefore, the correct answer is 105.\n\nDon't worry, it's great that you were able to estimate the answer and even double-checked your work by calculating the product of 9 and 106.
