      "content": "Based on the student's profile and recent learning events, it appears that they have a strong foundation in the concept of \"Find X - Simple\" but struggle with the specific variation of \"Find X@@@@ Simple\". Given their high forgetting score and recent knowledge loss, I'll create a practice question that's tailored to their current knowledge level, focusing on building their understanding of the concept and gradually introducing the \"@@@@\" variation.\n\nHere's the first practice question:\n\n**Question:** \n\nSolve for X in the equation: 3 * (X - 2) = 18\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1.  It's a simple algebraic equation that requires the student to isolate the variable X, which is a fundamental concept in \"Find X - Simple\".\n2.  The equation is straightforward, allowing the student to focus on applying the concept without getting overwhelmed by complex calculations.\n3.  The equation doesn't involve the \"@@@@\" variation, which will be introduced gradually as the student progresses through the practice questions.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n*   This question will help assess the student's ability to apply the concept of \"Find X - Simple\" to a straightforward algebraic equation.\n*   If the student struggles with this question, it may indicate a deeper issue with their understanding of algebraic equations or their ability to isolate variables.\n*   If the student answers the question correctly, it will provide a solid foundation for introducing the \"@@@@\" variation in subsequent questions.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n*   If the student answers the question correctly, proceed to the next question that introduces the \"@@@@\" variation, such as: 3 * (X - 2) @@ @@ (X + 5) = 18\n*   If the student struggles with the question, provide additional support and review of the concept of \"Find X - Simple\" before moving on to the next question.\n\nThis question is designed to be a gentle introduction to the concept, allowing the student to build their confidence and understanding before tackling more complex variations.",

      "content": "**Analysis of the Student's Last Answer**\n\nThe student has attempted to solve the equation 3(X - 5) = 15. They correctly divided both sides by 3, which is a great step in isolating the variable X. However, in the next step, they initially added 5 to both sides, which is incorrect. To isolate X, they should have subtracted 5 from both sides.\n\nThe correct solution would be:\n\n\\[\nX - 5 = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n\\]\n\n\\[\nX = 5 - 5 = 0\n\\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is indeed X = 0.\n\n**Encouragement and Feedback**\n\nYou're doing great! You're catching on quickly and are willing to think through the steps. Remember, isolating variables can sometimes require adding or subtracting the same value to both sides. In this case, you correctly identified that subtracting 5 from both sides would isolate X.\n\nLet's review the correct steps together:\n\n1.  Divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nX - 5 = \\frac{15}{3} = 5\n\\]\n\n2.  Now, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate X:\n\n\\[\nX = 5 - 5 = 0\n\\]\n\nYou got it now? The correct answer is indeed X = 0.\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nLet's try another question that will help you build your confidence in solving equations. Here's a new problem:\n\n**Question:** Solve for X in the equation: 2(X + 4) = 14\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1.  It's another simple algebraic equation that requires isolating the variable X.\n2.  The equation involves a different coefficient (2) and a constant (4), which will help you practice applying the concept in various scenarios.\n3.  This question doesn't involve the \"@@@@\" variation, so you can focus on mastering the basic concept before moving on to more complex variations.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n*   This question will help you assess your ability to apply the concept of \"Find X - Simple\" to a new equation with different coefficients and constants.\n*   If you struggle with this question, we can review the concept together and provide additional support.\n*   If you answer the question correctly, it will give you more confidence to tackle more complex equations and variations.\n\nTake your time, and remember to check your steps carefully. You're doing great!",
