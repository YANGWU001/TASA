Although they correctly identified that the slope is positive, they didn't calculate the slope correctly. To find the slope, they should have used the formula m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) with the given points (2, 3) and (4, 5). Plugging in the values, we get m = (5 - 3) / (4 - 2) = 2 / 2 = 1. Since the slope is 1, the correct equation should have a slope of 1x, not 2x. Therefore, the correct answer is **y = x + 1**, which matches option **D**.\n\n**Encouragement:**\n\nGreat effort, and I'm glad you thought to check if the slope was positive! You're on the right track, and with a bit more practice, you'll be able to calculate the slope accurately.

Although they correctly calculated the slope as 1, they again used the point-slope form y - y1 = m(x - x1) and solved for y, but they mistakenly decided to subtract the y-coordinate of the given point instead of adding it. In the point-slope form, when you solve for y, the correct operation to perform is addition, not subtraction. The correct equation of the line should be y = x + 1.\n\n**Encouragement:**\n\nExcellent effort, and I'm proud of you for trying to use the point-slope form again! You correctly calculated the slope, which is a great step. Remember, when using the point-slope form, you should solve for y by adding the product of the slope and the difference between x and the x-coordinate of the given point to the y-coordinate of the given point. Let's try another question to help you practice using the point-slope form to confirm your answer.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nNow that you've practiced finding the equation of a line with a positive slope, let's try a question that focuses on using the point-slope form to confirm your answer.
