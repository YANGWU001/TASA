Build on their current understanding of \"Using difficult numbers\" (40% accuracy)\n2. Gradually increase the difficulty level to challenge the student without overwhelming them\n3. Assess their understanding and identify areas for improvement\n\nHere's a suitable practice question:\n\n**Question:** \n\nWhat is the value of the expression: 7 \u00d7 9 - 2.5 + 0.8?\n\n**Difficulty level:** Moderate (involves basic arithmetic operations with decimal numbers and a mix of whole numbers)\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n* It involves a combination of multiplication, subtraction, and addition, which requires the student to apply their understanding of \"Using difficult numbers\" in a more complex context.\n* The presence of decimal numbers (2.5 and 0.8) will challenge the student to apply their understanding of decimal arithmetic, which is a key aspect of \"Using difficult numbers\".\n* The question is not too difficult, given the student's current 40% accuracy, but challenging enough to assess their understanding and identify areas for improvement.\n\nThis question will help the student practice their skills in a moderate difficulty context, allowing them to build on their existing knowledge and gradually increase their accuracy.",

To help you understand where you went wrong, let's break down the expression: 7 \u00d7 9 - 2.5 + 0.8.\n\nFirst, you need to multiply 7 and 9, which equals 63. Then, you need to subtract 2.5 from 63, which gives you 60.5. Finally, you need to add 0.8 to 60.5, resulting in 61.3.\n\nIt seems that you might have made a small mistake in one of these steps, but don't worry, we can work through it together. Let's try to identify the exact step where you went wrong.
