However, you're correct that the small number in the expression 5 \u00d7 8 + 3 is indeed 3. But, you're not using the correct approach for simplifying the multiplication part. \n\nWhen dividing by a small number, you can multiply by its reciprocal. In this case, the reciprocal of 3 is 1/3. To simplify 5 \u00d7 8, you can multiply 5 by the reciprocal of 3 (which is 1/3) and then multiply that result by 8. However, a more straightforward approach would be to simply multiply 5 by 8 to get 40, and then subtract 3 from 40 to get 37. So, the correct calculation is: 40 - 3 = 37. But in this case, you were close with your initial calculation, but you forgot to multiply by the reciprocal of 3. \n\nThe correct calculation using the strategy would be: 5 \u00d7 (1/3) \u00d7 8 = (5 \u00d7 8) / 3 = 40 / 3 \u2248 13.33, and then adding the remaining 3 would be incorrect, as you would need to add it to 40, not 13.33.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Using small numbers: Simplifying Expressions with Multiplication and Addition**\n\nSimplify the expression: 6 \u00d7 2 + 4\n\n**Your Task:** Use the same strategy as before: divide the coefficient of the term by the small number, then multiply the result by the other number, and finally add the remaining number.\n\n**Hint:** Remember that when dividing by a small number, you can also multiply by its reciprocal.

You correctly identified the small number in the expression as 5 and divided the coefficient 9 by the small number to get 1.8. Then, you multiplied that result by the other number 2 to get 3.6, which is correct. However, when adding the remaining number 5, you should have added it to 3.6, not to 1.8. The correct calculation would be: 9 \u00d7 5 = 45, and then adding the remaining 2 would be 45 + 2 = 47, not 3.6 + 5 = 8.6. The correct answer is 47. Don't worry, it's a small mistake, and we can practice more to get it right.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Using small numbers: Simplifying Expressions with Multiplication and Addition**\n\nSimplify the expression: 12 \u00d7 3 + 1\n\n**Your Task:** Use the same strategy as before: divide the coefficient of the term by the small number, then multiply the result by the other number, and finally add the remaining number.\n\n**Hint:** Remember that when dividing by a small number, you can also multiply by its reciprocal. Take your time, and think carefully before answering.\n\nThis question is designed to help you solidify your understanding of the strategy and apply it to more complex expressions.",
