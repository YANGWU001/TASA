However, they incorrectly solved the equation. The student first divided 16 by 4 to get 4, which is correct, but then multiplied both sides by 2 to get X = 4 + 2 = 6, which is incorrect. The correct solution involves multiplying 4 by the result of X \u00f7 2 to get 4 \u00d7 (X \u00f7 2) = 4X \u00f7 2 = 2X, and then equating it to 16. To isolate X, the student should divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get X = 16 \u00f7 2 = 8.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's current knowledge state, it's essential to provide a question that builds upon their recent struggles with \"Remove coefficient; Variable in denominator\" and \"Find X \u2013 Simple\" in a more complex equation. A suitable next step would be to introduce a question that requires the student to apply their understanding of these concepts in a more complex equation, possibly involving fractions or decimals.\n\n**Practice Question 6:**\n\nGiven the equation: (X \u00f7 3) + 2 = 6, what is the value of X?\n\n**Expected Reasoning:**\n\nTo solve for X, you'll need to isolate X on one side of the equation. First, subtract 2 from both sides to get rid of the constant term. Then, divide both sides by the coefficient (1/3) to find the value of X. Take your time, and make sure to double-check your calculation.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n(X \u00f7 3) + 2 = 6\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\n\n(X \u00f7 3) = 6 - 2\n\n(X \u00f7 3) = 4\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to get the value of X:\n\nX = 4 \u00d7 3\n\nX = 12\n\nTake a moment to think about the solution, and then let me know your answer.",
