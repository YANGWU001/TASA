This will help the student to apply their understanding of the concept in a practical way.\n4.  **Gradual difficulty:** The question is not too complex, but still requires the student to apply their knowledge of writing expressions with a negative slope, making it a good starting point for building their understanding and confidence.\n\nThis question will help the student assess their understanding of writing expressions for a negative slope and provide a foundation for further practice and improvement.",

When finding the slope using the two points (0, 5) and (-2, 3), they correctly applied the formula but arrived at the wrong result. The correct calculation is:\n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{5-3}{0-(-2)}=\\frac{2}{2}=1.\n\\]\n\nBut, the problem specifies that the line should have a negative slope. The student correctly recognized this and attempted to adjust the slope, but this step is not necessary. The issue lies in the initial calculation of the slope. To get a negative slope, we need to use a different pair of points or re-examine the initial calculation.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the slope calculation:\n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{3-5}{-2-0}=\\frac{-2}{-2}=1\n\\]\n\nHowever, we can use the other point (0, 5) to get a negative slope by choosing a different point to subtract from it. Let's use the point (-2, 3) and find the slope using the points (0, 5) and (2, 3), which is not given but can be obtained by adding 2 to -2. However, since that is not one of our options, we can use the points (0, 5) and (2, 3) is not available so let's use (0,5) and (-2,3).\n\n\\[\nm=\\frac{5-3}{0-(-2)}=\\frac{2}{2}=1.\n\\]\n\nHowever, this is the same result we got before.
