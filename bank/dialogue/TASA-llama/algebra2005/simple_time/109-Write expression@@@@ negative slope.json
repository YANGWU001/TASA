The correct calculation for the slope is indeed (1 - 3) / (4 - 2) = -2 / 2 = -1. \n\nA negative slope indicates that the line is decreasing as it moves from left to right. This means that for every one unit increase in x, y decreases by one unit. Your expression y = x + 1 is actually for a line with a positive slope, which would indicate an increase in y as x increases.\n\nTo write an expression for a line with a negative slope that passes through the points (2, 3) and (4, 1), you need to consider the relationship between the change in y and the change in x. Since the line is decreasing, you should subtract 1 from y for every 1 unit increase in x. This can be represented as y - 3 = -1(x - 2), which simplifies to y = -x + 5.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding and retention, the next question should be slightly more challenging but still within their grasp.

      "content": "**Explanation of Student's Last Answer:**\n\nGreat job on trying to apply the concept of slope to the given points! However, there's a small mistake in your calculation of the slope. The change in y is indeed -3, and the change in x is indeed -2. But when you divide -3 by -2, you get a positive fraction 3/2, which represents a positive slope. This means the line is increasing as it moves from left to right, not decreasing.\n\nFor a line with a negative slope that passes through the points (0, 4) and (-2, 1), you should expect the line to decrease as it moves from left to right. This means for every 1 unit increase in x, y should decrease by a certain amount. Let's recalculate the slope with the correct sign: the change in y is -3, and the change in x is -2, so the slope m = (-3) / (-2) = 3/2 is still positive. This means your initial approach to finding the slope was correct, but the interpretation of the result was incorrect.\n\nHowever, the point-slope form you used is correct: y - 4 = (3/2)(x - 0). Simplifying it, you get y = (3/2)x + 4, which is indeed the equation of a line with a positive slope.\n\nTo write an expression for a line with a negative slope, you should consider the relationship between the change in y and the change in x, but with a negative slope. Let's try again. The change in y is -3, and the change in x is -2. This means for every 1 unit increase in x, y should decrease by 3/2 units. To represent this relationship, we can use the point-slope form with a negative slope: y - 4 = (-3/2)(x - 0). Simplifying this, we get y = -3/2x + 4.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding and retention, the next question should be slightly more challenging but still within their grasp.

You correctly found the change in y and x, but then you calculated the slope as -3 / 1 = -3, which is correct! However, you didn't consider the correct sign for the slope. A negative slope means the line is decreasing as it moves from left to right. Since the change in y is -3 and the change in x is 1, the slope should be -3, which you got right. \n\nNow, let's use the point-slope form to write the expression for the line. You're on the right track with y - (-2) = (-3)(x - (-1)). Simplifying this, you get y + 2 = -3(x + 1), which further simplifies to y + 2 = -3x - 3. To isolate y, you can subtract 2 from both sides, resulting in y = -3x - 5. \n\nYou were close, but remember that a negative slope indicates a decrease in y for every unit increase in x.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding and retention, the next question should be slightly more challenging but still within their grasp.

      "content": "**Explanation of Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYou've started on the right track by identifying the change in y and x. However, you've again gotten stuck on the slope. The change in y is indeed 1, and the change in x is 1, but you're forgetting that a negative slope means the line is decreasing as it moves from left to right. In this case, the point (4, 2) is to the right of the point (3, 1), so the change in x is 1 unit to the right, and the change in y is 1 unit down. This means the slope should be negative. Let's recalculate the slope using the correct change in y and x: (1) / (1) is not correct, since the change in y is actually 1 unit down, so it should be (-1) / (1) = -1. Now, let's use the point-slope form to write the expression for the line.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding and retention, the next question should be slightly more challenging but still within their grasp. Here's a practice question that focuses on another aspect of writing expressions for negative slopes:\n\n**Question:** Write an expression for the line that passes through the points (5, 6) and (7, 4).\n\n**Hint:** Think about the change in y and x, and how it relates to the slope of the line.

You correctly recognized that the line is decreasing as it moves from left to right, so you treated the slope as -2. This is correct. However, when using the point-slope form, you need to be careful with the signs. You correctly wrote the point-slope form as y - 9 = -2(x + 3), but when expanding it, you should have gotten y - 9 = -2x - 6. However, when simplifying, you forgot to add 9 to both sides, which led to y = -2x + 3 instead of y = -2x + 9.
