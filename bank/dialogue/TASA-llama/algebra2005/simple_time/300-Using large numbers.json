Adding this to the initial 2100, you get 2280, which is close to your initial estimate of 2400. However, the correct total is actually 2700. Don't worry, though - you were close, and it's great that you're thinking about the problem in the right way!\n\n**Let's Try Another Question**\n\nHere's a new question that's designed to help you continue building on your progress:\n\n**Practice Question 7: Multiplying Large Numbers with a Larger Multiplier and a Larger Quantity**\n\nImagine you have 96 groups of folders, and each group contains 49 folders. How many folders do you have in total?\n\nA) 4,500\nB) 4,700\nC) 4,800\nD) 4,900\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1. Help you practice multiplying a larger quantity by a smaller quantity (49 folders per group).\n2. Encourage you to use your multiplication skills to find the total number of folders.\n3. Gradually increase the difficulty by introducing an even more complex calculation.\n\nTake your time, and remember that it's okay to make mistakes. We're here to learn and improve together!",

Unfortunately, this is not the correct answer.\n\nLet's break it down together: 96 groups of folders with 49 folders each is a large multiplication problem. You can break it down into smaller parts to make it more manageable. Since 100 groups of 49 folders would be 4,900, you can subtract the remaining 4 groups of folders to get the total. 4 groups of 49 folders is 196, and subtracting this from 4,900 gives you 4,704.
