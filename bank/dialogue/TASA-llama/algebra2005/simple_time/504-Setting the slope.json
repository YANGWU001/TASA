What is the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m represents the slope?\n\n**Hint:** Use the two given points to find the slope.\n\n**Your task:** Find the slope (m) using the two given points, and then write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b).\n\n**Note:** This question is designed to assess the student's ability to set the slope using two points.

However, division by zero is undefined in mathematics, which means that the slope cannot be determined using this method. The student is correct in recognizing that the line is horizontal, but the slope being zero is a consequence of the horizontal nature of the line, not a result of the division by zero. The correct approach is to recognize that the line is horizontal and use the point (4, 2) to write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form, y = b. Since the line is horizontal, the value of b is equal to the y-coordinate of any point on the line, which is 2.\n\n**Corrected Solution:** y = 2\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help the student build their skills in setting the slope and writing the equation of a line in slope-intercept form, let's try a question that will help them practice finding the slope using two points, and then solving for the y-intercept.
