This question assesses the student's ability to use small numbers, which is a fundamental concept in basic arithmetic.\n2.  It involves a simple equation with a coefficient (2x), which is a common transformation related to using small numbers.\n3.  The solution requires the student to isolate the variable (x) by performing a basic operation (division), which should be within their grasp given their current skill level.\n4.  The answer choices are straightforward and easy to evaluate, allowing the student to demonstrate their understanding of the concept without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\n\nThis question helps the student practice the following skills:\n\n1.  Identifying and working with small numbers\n2.  Understanding the concept of coefficients and their impact on equations\n3.  Isolating variables in simple equations\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nAfter the student attempts this question, I'll assess their response and provide feedback to help them understand where they went wrong and how to improve. We can then progress to more challenging questions or review the concept further to solidify their understanding.",
