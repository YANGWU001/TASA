Given this, the first practice question should be tailored to help the student regain their footing and build their confidence.\n\nHere's a suitable practice question to start with:\n\n**Question:** Write an expression for the slope of the line that passes through the points (-3, 2) and (0, -1).\n\n**Hint:** Recall that the slope of a line is calculated using the formula m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the two points.\n\n**Expected outcome:** The student should be able to apply the formula to find the slope, which will be negative. This will help the student regain their understanding of writing expressions for a negative slope.\n\n**Modification for the student's level:** Since the student has struggled with writing expressions for a negative slope, the question provides a specific scenario with two points, making it easier to calculate the slope. This will help the student build their confidence and gradually transition to more complex expressions.\n\nThis question assesses the student's ability to apply the formula and calculate the slope, which should help them regain their understanding of writing expressions for a negative slope.",

      "content": "**Understanding your previous response**\n\nIt looks like you're having trouble with the previous question about writing an expression for the slope of a line passing through two points. That's okay, and it's a great opportunity to learn and improve. The correct answer would involve using the slope formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). In this case, we have the points (-3, 2) and (0, -1). To find the slope, you would subtract the y-coordinates and the x-coordinates: m = (-1 - 2) / (0 - (-3)) = (-3) / (3) = -1. So, the expression for the slope would be -1.\n\n**Your current knowledge state**\n\nYou're struggling to write expressions for a negative slope, and it's affecting your performance. Don't worry, we can work through this together! You've shown that you can apply the slope formula, but it seems you need a bit more practice to feel confident with negative slopes.\n\n**Next practice question**\n\nLet's try a question that's a bit more straightforward, but still challenging. Here it is:\n\n**Question:** Write an expression for the slope of the line that passes through the points (2, 5) and (4, 3).\n\n**Hint:** Use the slope formula and focus on the signs of the numbers. Remember, if the difference between the y-coordinates is negative and the difference between the x-coordinates is positive, the slope will be negative.\n\nThis question will help you practice applying the slope formula and identifying negative slopes in a more straightforward scenario.
