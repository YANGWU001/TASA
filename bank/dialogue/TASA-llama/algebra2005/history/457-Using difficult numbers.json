The question involves a division operation, which is a challenging concept for the student, given their low mastery level of \"Using difficult numbers.\"\n2.  The equation requires the student to perform a subtraction operation within the parentheses before performing the division, which adds an extra layer of complexity.\n3.  The numbers involved are \"difficult\" (456 and 7) and require the student to demonstrate their understanding of decimal operations.\n4.  The question is not too easy or too hard, as it's designed to be slightly challenging but still accessible for a student with a moderate mastery level.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\nThe student's response will indicate their current level of understanding and ability to apply the concept of \"Using difficult numbers.\" Their answer will help me assess their strengths and weaknesses, and I can adjust the subsequent questions to better support their learning and build their confidence.",
