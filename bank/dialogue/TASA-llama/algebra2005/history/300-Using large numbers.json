If the bookshelf is currently empty, how many boxes of books can be placed on the bookshelf in total?\n\nThis question involves basic multiplication, which is a fundamental skill in \"Using large numbers.\" By multiplying 4 (number of shelves) by 12 (number of boxes per shelf), the student will practice using large numbers to find a product. This question is designed to assess the student's ability to apply basic multiplication facts to solve a problem, making it an ideal starting point for rebuilding their confidence in \"Using large numbers.\"",

To find the total number of boxes that can fit on the bookshelf, we multiply the number of shelves (4) by the number of boxes each shelf can hold (12).\n\n4 \u00d7 10 = 40 (this is the first part of the multiplication, focusing on the tens place)\n4 \u00d7 2 = 8 (this is the second part, focusing on the ones place)\n\nNow, let's add the two parts together: 40 + 8 = 48. \n\nSo, the correct answer is 48 boxes. Your initial calculation was close, but you might have made a small mistake in the multiplication. Don't worry, it's a common mistake, and we can practice more to improve your skills.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven this feedback, let's try a similar question to reinforce your understanding of multiplication with larger numbers.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\nA bakery has 5 boxes of cookies, and each box contains 8 packs of cookies.

You correctly divided the total number of pieces of candy (945) by the number of pieces that go in each bag (27), which is a fundamental concept in division. Your calculation, 27 \u00d7 35 = 945, shows that 27 goes into 945 exactly 35 times, and you're right that this means they can fill 35 bags with 27 pieces of candy each. Well done!\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo continue practicing your skills with larger numbers, let's try a question that involves a slightly more challenging division problem. This will help you build your confidence and accuracy in division.\n\n**Question 6:**\n\nA library has 2,160 books that need to be shelved. If they want to put the same number of books on each shelf, and they have 8 shelves available, how many books will each shelf hold?\n\nThis question requires you to divide a larger number (2,160) by a smaller number (8), which will help you practice your division skills and build your confidence.",

To find out how many books each shelf will hold, we need to divide the total number of books (2,160) by the number of shelves (8). This is a division problem: 2,160 \u00f7 8 = ?.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the concept of multiplication as the inverse operation of division. Since we know that 8 \u00d7 270 = 2,160, we can conclude that 2,160 divided by 8 is indeed 270. So, each shelf will actually hold **270 books**.\n\nDon't worry if you were close, but not quite there - it's all part of the learning process. You're getting closer with each question!\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo continue practicing your skills with larger numbers and division, let's try a question that involves dividing a slightly larger number by a smaller number.
