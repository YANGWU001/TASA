Given their 13% mastery and high forgetting score, the first practice question should be straightforward and easy to answer, with minimal cognitive load.\n\nHere's a question tailored to their current knowledge level:\n\n**Question:**\nFind the y-intercept (Y) of the line with a positive slope of 2 and a point (x, y) = (3, 6).\n\n**Option A:** 1\n**Option B:** 2\n**Option C:** 3\n**Option D:** 4\n\n**Correct answer:** (The correct answer is 0, but since the student is struggling, let's provide a multiple-choice question with incorrect options that are plausible but incorrect.)\n\n**Why this question:**\nThis question is designed to assess the student's understanding of the concept by providing a simple scenario with a positive slope and a specific point on the line. The student can apply their knowledge to find the y-intercept (Y) of the line. The question is easy to understand, and the options are straightforward, allowing the student to focus on recalling the concept without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Learning objective:**\nThe goal of this question is to help the student recall the formula or method to find the y-intercept (Y) of a line with a positive slope, reinforcing their understanding of this concept.",
