Write an expression in the form y = mx + b that represents this line.\n\n**A)** y = 3x - 2\n**B)** y = -3x + 2\n**C)** y = -3x - 2\n**D)** y = 3x + 2\n\n**Explanation:** This question is designed to assess the student's understanding of writing expressions for negative slopes. The student will need to recall that a negative slope indicates a downward trend, and that the slope-intercept form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. The correct answer, y = -3x + 2, reflects a negative slope of -3 and a y-intercept of 2.\n\nThis question is tailored to the student's current knowledge level, as it:\n\n* Builds on their moderate understanding of writing expressions for negative slopes\n* Provides a straightforward scenario to apply their knowledge\n* Offers a clear and concise explanation of the concept\n\n**Immediate Feedback:** After submitting their answer, the student will receive immediate feedback in the form of:\n\n* Correctness: Did the student correctly write the expression for the negative slope?\n* Explanation: A clear and concise explanation of the correct answer, highlighting the student's understanding of the concept\n* Next Steps: Recommendations for further practice or review to solidify their understanding of writing expressions for negative slopes.",

The reason is that you correctly identified the slope as -3, but then mistakenly applied the negative sign to the x-term instead of the slope itself.
