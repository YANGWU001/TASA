Let's break it down together: \n\nThe equation given is 2x + 5 = 11. To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable (x) on one side of the equation. \n\nFirst, we subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term: 2x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5, which simplifies to 2x = 6.\n\nNext, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x: 2x / 2 = 6 / 2, which simplifies to x = 3.\n\nUnfortunately, your answer, x = 2, is not correct. However, this is a great opportunity to learn and practice the correct steps.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question that builds on the concept of isolating variables in equations.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx - 3 = 7\n\nThis question requires the same algebraic manipulation as the previous one, but with a slight twist.
