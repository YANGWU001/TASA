The numbers involved (4 and 9) are small and manageable, making it a good starting point for the student. The options provided are close together, making it easier for the student to choose the correct answer. This question assesses the student's ability to perform basic multiplication, which is a fundamental concept in \"Using small numbers\".\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n* The student has shown a low mastery of this concept, so the question is designed to be challenging yet not overwhelming.\n* The numbers involved are small, making it easier for the student to focus on the concept rather than being overwhelmed by large numbers.\n* The question requires the student to apply their understanding of multiplication, which is a key aspect of \"Using small numbers\".\n* The options provided are close together, making it easier for the student to choose the correct answer.\n\nBy answering this question, the student will be able to demonstrate their understanding of the concept and identify areas where they need improvement.",
