Unfortunately, they're unsure of how to answer this question. This is a bit of a setback after their previous success with identifying the place value of the digit 8 in the number 94,213.\n\nDon't worry, it's normal to encounter challenges along the way. Let's break down the concept of place value together. In the number 5,421,678, the digit 5 is actually in the thousands place. To determine its value, we need to multiply 5 by 1,000, since there are three places to the left of the digit 5. Therefore, the correct value of the digit 5 is 5,000.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nTo help you build back your confidence and reinforce your understanding of place value, let's try a simpler question that involves identifying the place value of a specific digit within a multi-digit number. This time, let's focus on a number with a smaller digit in the tens place.\n\n**Question 7: Place Value of Tens**\n\nWhat is the value of the digit 3 in the number 543?\n\nA) 30\nB) 3\nC) 300\nD) 0.03\nE) 0.3\n\nTake your time, and see if you can determine the value of the digit 3 in the number 543.\n\nThis question allows you to:\n\n1. Practice identifying the place value of a specific digit within a multi-digit number.\n2. Develop your understanding of the relationship between digits and their corresponding place values.\n3. Build confidence in your ability to analyze and break down large numbers into smaller parts.\n\nBy providing a single-digit answer choice, you can focus on the specific concept of place value without being overwhelmed by multiple-choice options.",
