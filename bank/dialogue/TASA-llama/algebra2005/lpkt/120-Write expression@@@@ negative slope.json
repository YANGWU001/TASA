Here's the question:\n\n**Question:** Write an expression for the slope of the line that passes through the points (2, 5) and (4, 3).\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n* The student is struggling with writing expressions for negative slopes, so I'm providing a problem where the slope is not explicitly given as negative. This will help them practice identifying the slope in a more general sense.\n* The points (2, 5) and (4, 3) form a line with a negative slope, which is suitable for the student's current knowledge level.\n* The question requires the student to apply the slope formula (m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)) to find the slope, which will help them practice the concept of writing an expression for a negative slope.\n\n**Suggested solution:**\n\nTo find the slope, the student should use the slope formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nm = (3 - 5) / (4 - 2)\nm = -2 / 2\nm = -1\n\nThe expression for the slope is -1.",

They correctly identified the points to use for the formula and wrote the expression \\(m = \\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}} = \\frac{1-4}{3-6}\\). They also correctly simplified the expression to \\(\\frac{-3}{-3}\\). However, their uncertainty about the sign of the slope led them to question their answer. The correct answer is indeed 1, as the slope of a line passing through the points (6, 4) and (3, 1) is positive. The student's answer was initially correct, but they doubted themselves, which led to a moment of uncertainty.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Question:** Write an expression for the slope of the line that passes through the points (5, 3) and (8, -2).\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n* This question requires the student to apply the slope formula in a similar way to the previous questions, but with new points.\n* The points (5, 3) and (8, -2) form a line with a negative slope, which is suitable for the student's current knowledge level.\n* This question will help the student practice the concept of finding the slope of a line with a negative slope and build confidence in their ability to apply the slope formula.\n\n**Suggested solution:**\n\nTo find the slope, the student should use the slope formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\nm = (-2 - 3) / (8 - 5)\nm = -5 / 3\nm = -5/3\n\nThe expression for the slope is -5/3.",
