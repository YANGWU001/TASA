      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYour answer, **A) -1**, is incorrect. The correct answer is actually **B) 1**.\n\nWhen a line has a positive slope, it means that as the x-coordinate increases, the y-coordinate also increases. In this case, the line passes through the point (1, 3), which means that when x = 1, y = 3. Since the slope is positive (2), for every one unit increase in x, y increases by 2 units. To find the y-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x-axis, we need to set x = 0 (since any point on the x-axis has an x-coordinate of 0). \n\nUsing the slope formula, y = mx + b, where m is the slope (2) and b is the y-intercept (which we need to find), we can plug in x = 0 to get y = 2(0) + b. This simplifies to y = b, so the y-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x-axis is equal to the y-intercept (b).\n\nHowever, since we know that the line passes through the point (1, 3), we can use this information to find the y-intercept. Plugging in x = 1 and y = 3 into the equation y = mx + b, we get 3 = 2(1) + b, which simplifies to 3 = 2 + b. Solving for b, we get b = 1.\n\nTherefore, the y-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x-axis is 1, which is option B.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question 2: Short Answer**\n\nFind the y-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x-axis if the line has a positive slope of 3 and passes through the point (2, 5).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThis question requires the student to apply their understanding of the concept by finding the y-coordinate of a point on a line with a positive slope. The student will need to recall that a positive slope indicates the line rises from left to right and apply this knowledge to find the correct y-coordinate.\n\n**Why this question is suitable for the student's current knowledge level:**\n\n- The question involves a positive slope, which aligns with the student's current focus area.\n- The line passes through a specific point, making it more concrete and easier to understand for the student.\n- The y-coordinate of the x-axis is a straightforward calculation that should be within the student's current understanding of the concept.\n- This question requires the student to apply the concept to a new scenario, which will help them build their understanding and problem-solving skills.\n\nThis question will help the student build their confidence and fluency in finding the y-coordinate of a point on a line with a positive slope.",

To find the y-coordinate of the y-axis, you should set x = 0 in the equation of the line. You also didn't substitute the given point (4, 6) into the equation to solve for b, which is a crucial step in finding the correct equation of the line. Let's try again: the equation of the line is y = 5x + b. Since the line passes through the point (4, 6), we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for b: 6 = 5(4) + b. Simplifying this equation, we get 6 = 20 + b, so b = -14. Now that we have the equation y = 5x - 14, we can find the y-coordinate of the y-axis by setting x = 0: y = 5(0) - 14 = -14.

To find the y-coordinate of the y-axis, we need to set x = 0 in the equation of the line. Let's recall the concept: the equation of the line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the line has a positive slope of 2, the equation is y = 2x + b. We know the line passes through the point (0, -3), so we can substitute these values into the equation to solve for b: -3 = 2(0) + b. Simplifying this equation, we get -3 = 0 + b, so b = -3. Now that we have the equation y = 2x - 3, we can find the y-coordinate of the y-axis by setting x = 0: y = 2(0) - 3 = -3.
