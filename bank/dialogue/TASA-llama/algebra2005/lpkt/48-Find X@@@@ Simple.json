The student has shown a moderate mastery level of 44% on \"Find X@@@@ Simple\" and struggles with \"Find X@@@@ Simple\" and \"Find X \u2013 Simple\". Given this information, I will create a question that focuses on the concept of \"Find X@@@@ Simple\" with a positive slope.\n\n**Question:**\n\nSolve for x: 2x + 5 = 11\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1.  The question is a basic linear equation, which aligns with the student's current knowledge level.\n2.  The equation has a positive slope, which is relevant to the \"Find X@@@@ Simple\" concept.\n3.  The question requires the student to apply the concept of solving for x, which is a fundamental skill in algebra.\n4.  The equation is not too complex, allowing the student to focus on the concept of solving for x without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\nBy solving this question, the student will demonstrate their ability to apply the concept of solving for x in a linear equation with a positive slope. This will help assess their understanding of \"Find X@@@@ Simple\" and provide an opportunity for them to build on their current knowledge.",
