However, 3 boxes are filled with 20 books each, while the remaining boxes are still filled with 25 books each. If you need to count the total number of books, how many books are on the bookshelf in total?\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1.  This question requires the student to apply their understanding of using difficult numbers, which involves working with numbers that are not easy to manipulate (in this case, 18, 25, 20).\n2.  The question presents a realistic scenario, making it more engaging and relevant to the student's interests.\n3.  The problem requires the student to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication), which will help them build their confidence and fluency with numbers.\n4.  The question is not too complex or overwhelming, given the student's current mastery level (40%), making it a suitable starting point for practice and improvement.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nThis question will help assess the student's ability to:\n\n1.  Apply their understanding of using difficult numbers in a practical scenario.\n2.  Perform basic arithmetic operations with numbers that are not easy to manipulate.\n3.  Build their confidence and fluency with numbers.\n\n**Learning Opportunity:**\n\nBy attempting this question, the student will have the opportunity to:\n\n1.  Review and practice using difficult numbers in a real-world context.\n2.  Develop their problem-solving skills and critical thinking.\n3.  Improve their accuracy and confidence in working with numbers.\n\nI will be happy to provide feedback and guidance after the student attempts this question.",

Let's break down the mistake:\n\nYou correctly understood that the bakery sells 3/5 of the bread as whole wheat, but you didn't apply this fraction correctly. To find the number of whole-wheat loaves, you need to multiply the total number of loaves (240) by the fraction 3/5.\n\nTo do this, you can multiply 240 by 3 and then divide by 5. Multiplying 240 by 3 gives 720, and dividing 720 by 5 gives 144.

They correctly identified the amount of flour needed as 4.5 cups, which can be represented as 4 and a half cups. However, they did not attempt to find out how many shelves will be completely filled with the given amount of boxes.\n\nTo fill the bookshelf, we need to find out how many boxes can be placed on each shelf and how many shelves can be completely filled. Since each shelf can hold 2/3 of a box of books, and we have 9 boxes, we can start by dividing 9 by 2/3.\n\nTo divide 9 by 2/3, we can multiply 9 by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2. So, 9 \u00f7 2/3 = 9 \u00d7 3/2 = 27/2 = 13.5.\n\nSince each shelf can hold 2/3 of a box, we can find out how many shelves can be completely filled by dividing 13.5 by 2/3. We can do this by multiplying 13.5 by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2. However, since 13.5 is already a decimal, we can simply divide it by 2/3.\n\n13.5 \u00f7 2/3 = 13.5 \u00d7 3/2 = 20.25. Since we have 3 shelves, we can completely fill 2 shelves (2 \u00d7 2/3 = 4/3 = 1.33, which is less than 2, but we can still fill 2 shelves completely, and then fill a third shelf partially). The remaining boxes will be 13.5 - 4 = 9.5 boxes.\n\nSo, 2 shelves will be completely filled, and 9.5 boxes will be left over.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current knowledge state and recent learning events, I'll create a new question that builds on their understanding of using difficult numbers and requires them to apply it in a slightly different context.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nA bakery sells a total of 3/4 of a cup of sugar in a day.

They correctly identified the total amount of sugar that can be sold in the whole day as 3/4 cup. However, they then attempted to find the amount left to be sold in the evening by adding the amount sold in the morning (1/6 cup) and the afternoon (1/4 cup). This is a good start, but they made a mistake by adding these fractions directly without finding a common denominator.\n\nTo add 1/6 and 1/4, we need to find a common denominator, which is 12. We can then convert both fractions to have a denominator of 12:\n\n1/6 = 2/12\n1/4 = 3/12\n\nNow we can add these fractions:\n\n2/12 + 3/12 = 5/12\n\nSo, the amount sold in the morning and afternoon is 5/12 cup. To find the amount left to be sold in the evening, we need to subtract this from the total amount sold in the day, which is 3/4 cup. We can convert 3/4 to have a denominator of 12:\n\n3/4 = 9/12\n\nNow we can subtract 5/12 from 9/12:\n\n9/12 - 5/12 = 4/12\n\nSo, the amount left to be sold in the evening is 4/12 cup, which can be simplified to 1/3 cup.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current knowledge state and recent learning events, I'll create a new question that builds on their understanding of using difficult numbers and requires them to apply it in a slightly different context.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nA recipe for making cookies requires 2/3 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of butter, and 1/6 cup of eggs.
