The student has shown low proficiency in writing expressions for a negative slope, so the question starts with a negative slope (-3) to reinforce their understanding of the concept.\n2.  The y-intercept is given as 2, which simplifies the question and allows the student to focus on writing the equation with the given slope.\n3.  The question asks for the equation in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), which is a common format for writing linear equations.\n\n**Answer Key:** y = -3x + 2",

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer**\n\nThe student's answer, y = -3x - 2, is actually very close to the correct solution, but it contains a small error. The correct equation for a line with a slope of -3 and a y-intercept of 2 is indeed y = -3x + 2, not y = -3x - 2. The mistake lies in the sign of the y-intercept (b). In the slope-intercept form of a linear equation (y = mx + b), the y-intercept is the value of b, which in this case is 2. However, the student incorrectly added a negative sign to the 2, resulting in -2. This mistake shows that the student is still struggling to correctly apply the concept of writing expressions for a negative slope.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nGiven the student's low mastery of writing expressions for a negative slope and their recent performance, the next question will be slightly more challenging to help them build their confidence and reinforce their understanding.\n\n**Question:** Find the equation of the line that passes through the points (0, 5) and (-2, 1).\n\n**Student's Task:** Write an expression for the equation of the line in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1.  This question requires the student to find the slope (m) using the two given points and then apply it to write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form.\n2.  The points (0, 5) and (-2, 1) are chosen so that the student can easily find the slope and y-intercept, making it a bit more challenging but still manageable.\n3.  By finding the slope and writing the equation, the student will reinforce their understanding of the concept of negative slopes and improve their ability to apply it to different scenarios.\n\n**Answer Key:** The student will need to find the slope (m) first, which can be calculated as m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (1 - 5) / (-2 - 0) = -4 / -2 = 2. Then, the equation of the line can be written as y = 2x + b. To find b, the student can substitute one of the points, such as (0, 5), into the equation: 5 = 2(0) + b, which gives b = 5. Therefore, the equation of the line is y = 2x + 5.",

The student also correctly found the y-intercept (b) using the point (0, 6). However, they should have used the exact value of the slope, -7/3, to write the equation of the line.
