The student will need to apply the concept of slope (m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)) and use it to write the equation of the line in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\nThis question is tailored to the student's current knowledge level because it:\n\n* Is a multiple-choice question, which will help the student practice selecting the correct equation without having to worry about the exact calculations.\n* Focuses on a specific concept (writing an equation of a line) that is closely related to writing expressions for a negative slope.\n* Provides a concrete and visual context (two points on a coordinate plane) to help the student understand the concept better.\n* Allows the student to apply the concept of slope to find the equation of the line, which is a key skill in writing expressions for a negative slope.\n\nThis question will help the student assess their understanding of the concept and build their confidence in writing expressions for a negative slope.",

You correctly calculated the slope using the formula m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) and got a negative slope, which matches the equation you chose. To find the slope, you used the points (-2, 4) and (1, 2), and the calculation is as follows:\n\nm = (2 - 4) / (1 - (-2))\nm = -2 / 3\nm = -2/3 (simplified to a fraction)\n\nHowever, you then used this slope to find the equation of the line. To do so, you need to find the y-intercept (b). You can use either point to find b. Let's use the point (1, 2):\n\n2 = (-2/3)(1) + b\n2 = -2/3 + b\nMultiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n6 = -2 + 3b\nAdd 2 to both sides:\n8 = 3b\nDivide both sides by 3:\nb = 8/3\n\nNow that you have the slope (m = -2/3) and the y-intercept (b = 8/3), you can write the equation of the line in the form y = mx + b:\n\ny = (-2/3)x + (8/3)\n\nTo match this equation to the answer choices, you can multiply both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by 3 to get rid of the fraction:\n\ny = (-2x + 8)\n\nNow, let's compare this equation to the answer choices. You chose D) y = -2x - 4, which is actually the same as our simplified equation. So, your initial answer is correct!\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nNow that you've shown your understanding of writing an equation of a line given two points, let's try a similar question that will help you build on this concept. Here's your next question:\n\nQuestion: What is the equation of the line that passes through the points (4, 6) and (-2, -2)?\n\nA) y = x + 4\nB) y = -x + 4\nC) y = 2x - 2\nD) y = -2x + 4\n\nThis question requires you to apply the same concept of slope and the equation of a line, but with a new set of points. Take your time, and see if you can find the correct equation of the line.",

Your initial calculation of the slope is incorrect, though. When finding the slope, you used the formula \\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\) with the points (1, 3) and (4, 6). The correct calculation should be:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{6 - 3}{4 - 1} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1\n\\]\n\nYou're correct that the slope is 1. However, you correctly used the point-slope form with the point (1, 3) to get the equation \\(y = x + 2\\).\n\nThe issue lies in your comparison with the answer choices. You correctly simplified the equation to \\(y = x + 2\\), but it's not among the options. The closest option is indeed A) \\(y = x + 3\\), but it's not exactly the same. The correct equation is actually \\(y = x + 2\\), which is not among the options.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nNow that you've practiced finding slopes and y-intercepts, let's try a question that will help you solidify your understanding of these concepts.
