This question will help the student build their understanding and assess their current abilities.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nSolve for x in the equation: 2x + 5 = 11\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 2x = 11 - 5\n2. Simplify the right side of the equation: 2x = 6\n3. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate x: x = 6 \u00f7 2\n\n**Question:** What is the value of x?\n\n**Guided Support:**\n\n* To help the student, I will provide a hint: \"Remember to isolate the variable by getting rid of the coefficient (the number in front of the variable).\"\n* If the student struggles, I will provide additional guidance on how to remove the coefficient and isolate the variable.\n\nThis question will allow the student to practice removing coefficients and isolating variables, which are key skills for mastering \"Using small numbers.\" The simple equation will help the student build confidence and assess their understanding of the concept.",

The confusion arises from the fact that when you add 3 to both sides, the -3 on the left side cancels out, leaving you with x = 7 + 3. To simplify this correctly, you should keep the 7 on the right side and say x = 7.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another equation to practice isolating variables.
