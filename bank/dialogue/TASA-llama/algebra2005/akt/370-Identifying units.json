Review and assess their understanding of Identifying units.\n2. Gradually build upon their existing knowledge.\n3. Provide a challenge that's not too easy but not too difficult.\n\nHere's a suitable first practice question:\n\n**Question:** \n\nTom has 5 boxes of pens, and each box contains 8 pens. How many pens does Tom have in total?\n\n**A)** 25 pens\n**B)** 30 pens\n**C)** 35 pens\n**D)** 40 pens\n\n**Task:** Identify the unit of measurement for the total number of pens.\n\n**Explanation:** This question assesses the student's ability to identify units by asking them to apply their understanding of multiplication and basic arithmetic operations. The student should recognize that the unit of measurement for the total number of pens is \"pens.\"",

You correctly multiplied the number of packs (3) by the weight of flour in each pack (2 pounds), which equals 6 pounds. However, when identifying the unit of measurement for the total weight of flour, you mistakenly stated that the unit is \"packs.\" The correct unit of measurement is indeed \"pounds,\" as the question asks for the quantity of flour measured in weight, not the container (packs).\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nGiven your understanding of Identifying units, let's try a question that's a bit more straightforward but still builds upon your existing knowledge. This question will help you solidify your understanding of units in a more concrete scenario.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA bakery sells 5 boxes of cookies, and each box contains 8 cookies.
