      "content": "Given the student's current low mastery level (\u22480.36) and high forgetting score (0.98), the first practice question should be designed to:\n\n1.  Revisit the concept of a negative slope\n2.  Gradually build upon the student's existing knowledge\n3.  Provide a gentle challenge to encourage improvement\n\nHere's a suitable practice question:\n\n**Question:** Write an expression for the slope of the line that passes through the points (2, -3) and (4, -5).\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1.  It revisits the concept of slope and encourages the student to apply it to a new scenario.\n2.  The points given are simple and linear, allowing the student to focus on recalling the formula for slope (m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)) without feeling overwhelmed.\n3.  The student must apply the concept of negative slope by correctly calculating the slope and expressing it in a suitable format.\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n\n*   The student will demonstrate their understanding of negative slope by correctly applying the formula and writing a suitable expression for the slope.\n*   This question will help the student rebuild their confidence in writing expressions for negative slopes, and the gentle challenge will encourage them to improve their accuracy.\n\n**Additional hint:**\n\n*   If the student struggles with the question, provide a gentle nudge by reminding them that a negative slope means the line is decreasing as it moves from left to right, and the expression should reflect this decrease.",

However, there's an error in the calculation of the denominator.\n\nWhen finding the numerator, you correctly found that \\(y_2 - y_1 = -6 - (-2) = -4\\).\n\nFor the denominator, you correctly identified \\(x_2 = 0\\) and \\(x_1 = 4\\), but then calculated \\(x_2 - x_1 = 0 - 4 = -4\\). However, this is incorrect. To find the correct denominator, you should calculate \\(x_2 - x_1 = 0 - 4 = -4\\), but since you're using the formula \\(m = \\dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\), the correct calculation for the denominator is actually \\(4 - 0 = 4\\), not \\(-4\\).\n\nSo, the correct fraction should be \\(\\dfrac{-4}{4}\\). This fraction simplifies to \\(-1\\).\n\n**Correcting the mistake:**\n\nTo find the slope, you should divide the numerator by the correct denominator, which is 4. The correct decimal approximation is \\(-1\\).\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven that you demonstrated understanding of the slope formula and need to improve your decimal conversion, let's try a similar question that will help you build upon your existing knowledge.\n\n**Question:** Find the slope of the line that passes through the points \\((3, 5)\\) and \\((8, 2)\\). Write your answer as a decimal.\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1.  This question is similar to the previous ones, allowing you to apply the slope formula again and build upon your existing knowledge.\n2.  The points given are simple and linear, making it easier for you to focus on calculating the slope without feeling overwhelmed.\n3.  This question will help you practice writing the slope expression in a suitable format.\n\n**Additional hint:**\n\n*   Remember that the slope expression should be a decimal, and you can use the formula \\(m = \\dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\) to find the slope.",
