      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nExcellent effort, student! Unfortunately, your answer is **Incorrect**. You stated that each box will get 7 cookies, but the correct answer is actually **B) 8** cookies per box. To arrive at this answer, you should have divided the total number of cookies (72) by the number of boxes (9). This calculation would have given you 72 \u00f7 9 = 8. Remember, when dividing a total quantity into equal groups, you're essentially sharing the items among the groups, so you'll always get a smaller number of items per group.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering your continued growth in using division to solve problems involving equal groups, the next question will introduce a slight variation by using a larger number of items and a more complex scenario. Here's a practice question to help you further develop your skills:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA farm has 108 apples to be distributed among 12 baskets for a harvest festival. If the apples are to be divided evenly among the baskets, how many apples will each basket contain?\n\n**A)** 8\n**B)** 9\n**C)** 10\n**D)** 11\n\n**Hint:** Think about how many groups the apples will be divided into and use division to find the answer.\n\nThis question requires you to apply your knowledge of division to a slightly more complex scenario with a larger number of items and more groups. You can use your current mastery level to solve this problem, which should be a good challenge for you to demonstrate your understanding of the concept.",
