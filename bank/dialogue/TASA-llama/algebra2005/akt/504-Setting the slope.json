What is the slope of this line?\n\n**Reasoning Skill:**\n\nTo answer this question, the student will need to apply the concept of setting the slope, which they are still developing. The question requires them to find the slope using the coordinates of two points on the line. This will help them practice the \"Write expression for a positive slope\" aspect of setting the slope, where they need to calculate the slope using the formula:\n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nThis question is designed to be challenging but manageable for the student, given their current level of mastery (~28% accuracy) and minimal forgetting (score 0.018).",

They correctly identified the coordinates of the two points and applied the formula, but their calculation contained a mix-up. They initially calculated the differences correctly, getting (5 - 2) = 3 and (3 - 1) = 2. However, they then incorrectly swapped the order of the differences, which led to an incorrect calculation. \n\nLet's break it down further: when we substitute the values into the formula, we get m = (5 - 2) / (3 - 1) = 3 / 2, which equals 1.5. The student correctly arrived at this result but then questioned it, which is a great sign of self-doubt and a willingness to learn. However, they also mentioned a second calculation with a negative result, which is incorrect.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven that the student struggled with the previous question and needs more practice with setting the slope, the next question will focus on reinforcing their understanding of the formula and helping them develop their calculation skills.

The student will need to calculate the differences between the y-coordinates and x-coordinates, and then apply the formula m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) to find the slope.

They thought the line was horizontal, reasoning that since the equation only has a fixed x-value, the y-values can change, and the line goes left-to-right like a horizontal line.

In the given equation x = 5, the x-coordinate is fixed, but it doesn't necessarily mean the line is horizontal.

The correct answer is that the line with the equation x = 5 is vertical.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven that the student still needs practice with identifying line orientation, the next question will focus on reinforcing their understanding of the characteristics of horizontal and vertical lines.
