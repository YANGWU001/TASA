Here's a question to help the student build their understanding and assess their current level:\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nWhat is the value of x in the equation: 5x = 15?\n\n**Why this question?**\n\nThis question is designed to assess the student's ability to apply the concept of using small numbers, specifically their understanding of multiplication and division. The student will need to recognize that 15 is 3 times 5, so the value of x must be 3.\n\n**Why it's tailored to their knowledge level:**\n\n1.  The question uses small numbers (5 and 15), which is the specific concept the student is trying to master.\n2.  The equation is simple and straightforward, making it accessible to a student with a 33% accuracy level.\n3.  The question requires the student to apply basic multiplication and division skills, which are fundamental to understanding small numbers.\n4.  The answer is a single-digit number, making it easy for the student to check their work and build confidence.\n\n**What to expect from the student:**\n\n*   If the student answers correctly (x = 3), it indicates they have a good understanding of the concept and can apply it to simple equations.\n*   If the student struggles or answers incorrectly, it will help identify areas where they need additional practice or review.\n*   If the student provides a correct answer but struggles with the explanation or reasoning, it will indicate that they may need additional support in understanding the underlying math concepts.",

They attempted to solve the equation 3x = 27 by thinking about the product of 3 and 6, which is 18, and thought it was close to 27. However, this approach is incorrect because it doesn't accurately apply the concept of division to solve the equation. To find the value of x, the student needs to divide both sides of the equation by 3, not think about the product. Dividing 27 by 3 gives us the correct answer, which is x = 9.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Practice Question 6:**\n\nSolve for y in the equation: 2y = 24\n\n**Why this question?**\n\nThis question is designed to help the student practice solving simple equations by applying the concept of division.
