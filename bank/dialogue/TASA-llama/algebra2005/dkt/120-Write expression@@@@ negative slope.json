They chose option B, y = -\\frac{1}{4}x + 4. However, this is not the correct equation of the line.\n\nTo find the slope, the student should have divided the difference in y-coordinates by the difference in x-coordinates: m = (0 - 4) / (5 - 0) = -4 / 5 = -\\frac{4}{5}.\n\nThe correct equation of the line in slope-intercept form is y = -\\frac{4}{5}x + b.
