Well done!\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering your continued improvement in using difficult numbers and your recent performance, the next question will build upon your understanding of decimal operations and provide a slightly more challenging scenario.\n\nQuestion:\n\nSimplify the expression: (3.5 - 2.9) \u00d7 1.7\n\nA) 2.1\nB) 2.4\nC) 3.2\nD) 3.6\nE) 4.0\n\nThis question requires you to apply your understanding of using difficult numbers in a basic arithmetic operation (subtraction and multiplication). You'll need to subtract 2.9 from 3.5, then multiply the result by 1.7. This question assesses your ability to handle decimals and apply the concept of using difficult numbers in a simple expression. Take your time, and remember to follow the order of operations: parentheses first, then multiplication. Good luck!",
