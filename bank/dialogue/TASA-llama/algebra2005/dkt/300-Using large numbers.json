This question uses small numbers, which the student has shown some proficiency with (85% accuracy in \"Using simple numbers\"), making it a good starting point.\n2.  It involves a basic arithmetic operation (+) that the student is familiar with, but in a larger number context, which is what they need to practice.\n3.  The question is straightforward and doesn't require any complex calculations, allowing the student to focus on understanding how to work with larger numbers without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**What to expect from the student:**\n\n- The student may initially struggle with this question due to their high level of forgetting in \"Using large numbers.\"\n- As they attempt the question, pay close attention to their thought process and any mistakes they might make, which can help identify areas of confusion or difficulty.\n- If the student answers incorrectly, use this as an opportunity to guide them through the correct solution, breaking it down into smaller steps, and gradually build their confidence in handling larger numbers.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n- If the student answers correctly, proceed with gradually increasing the difficulty of the questions, introducing larger numbers and more complex arithmetic operations.\n- If the student struggles, consider providing additional support and review of basic arithmetic operations, focusing on building their foundation in \"Using simple numbers\" before moving forward.",
