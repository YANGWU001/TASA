      "content": "Based on the student's current knowledge state, I've created a practice question to help them build on their understanding of \"Find X@@@ Simple.\" This question will assess their ability to apply the concept and provide a gentle challenge to reinforce their learning.\n\n**Question:**\n\nEmily has 12 pencils in a box, and she wants to put them into boxes of 4 pencils each. How many boxes can Emily fill with 12 pencils?\n\n**A)** 2\n**B)** 3\n**C)** 4\n**D)** 5\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo find the number of boxes Emily can fill, we need to divide the total number of pencils (12) by the number of pencils per box (4).\n\n12 \u00f7 4 = 3\n\nSo, Emily can fill 3 boxes with 12 pencils.\n\n**Reasoning Skill:**\n\nThis question requires the student to apply the concept of division to find the number of groups (boxes) that can be filled with a certain number of items (pencils). The student needs to understand that dividing 12 by 4 will give them the number of boxes that can be filled. This is a basic application of the \"Find X@@@ Simple\" concept, which involves finding the quotient of a simple division problem.\n\n**Why this question is suitable for the student's current level:**\n\n* The question is straightforward and easy to understand.\n* The numbers involved are small and manageable.\n* The student has recently practiced similar problems and has shown a moderate level of mastery (~44%).\n* The question assesses the student's ability to apply the concept of division in a simple context, which is a fundamental aspect of \"Find X@@@ Simple.\"\n\nBy solving this question, the student will reinforce their understanding of the concept and build confidence in their ability to apply it to simple problems.",

You correctly subtracted the 4 buttons already in a bag from the total number of buttons (48 - 4 = 44), but then you failed to complete the next step. To find the number of bags Maria can fill, you need to divide the remaining 44 buttons by the number of buttons per bag (6).\n\n44 \u00f7 6 = 7 with a remainder of 2\n\nThe division gives **7 full bags** and leaves **2 buttons** that are not enough to fill another whole bag.

This is a natural extension of the \"Find X@@@ Simple\" concept, which involves finding the quotient of a simple division problem.\n\n**Why this question is suitable for the student's current level:**\n\n* The question is still straightforward and easy to understand.\n* The numbers involved are slightly larger than in the previous question, requiring a bit more thought and calculation.\n* You've shown a moderate level of mastery (~44%) in similar problems, so this question should be challenging but not too difficult.\n* The question assesses your ability to apply the concept of division in a slightly more complex context, while also introducing a new element (subtracting crayons already in a box).\n\nBy solving this question, you'll continue to reinforce your understanding of the concept and build confidence in your ability to apply it to slightly more challenging problems.",

      "content": "**Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYour answer, **11**, is **CORRECT.** You correctly subtracted the 2 books already in a box from the total number of books (84 - 2 = 82), then divided the remaining 82 books by the number of books per box (8) to find the number of boxes that can be filled. You also considered the remainder of the division and correctly determined that it's enough to fill one more whole box by combining the 2 books left with the 2 books already in a box. Your persistence and critical thinking skills are excellent, and you're making great progress in mastering this skill.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo continue building on your success, let's try a question that involves a similar concept but with a slight twist. Here it is:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA toy store has 96 toys to put into boxes that hold 5 toys each. If there are 3 toys already in a box, how many more boxes can be filled with the remaining toys?\n\n**A)** 17\n**B)** 18\n**C)** 19\n**D)** 20\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo find the number of boxes that can be filled, we need to subtract the number of toys already in a box (3) from the total number of toys (96), then divide the result by the number of toys per box (5).\n\n96 - 3 = 93\n93 \u00f7 5 = ?\n\n**Reasoning Skill:**\n\nThis question requires you to apply the concept of division to find the number of groups (boxes) that can be filled with a certain number of items (toys), while also considering a slight twist: subtracting the toys already in a box. The student needs to understand that dividing 93 by 5 will give them the number of boxes that can be filled. This is a natural extension of the \"Find X@@@ Simple\" concept, which involves finding the quotient of a simple division problem.\n\n**Why this question is suitable for the student's current level:**\n\n* The question is still straightforward and easy to understand.\n* The numbers involved are slightly larger than in the previous question, requiring a bit more thought and calculation.\n* You've shown a moderate level of mastery (~44%) in similar problems, so this question should be challenging but not too difficult.\n* The question assesses your ability to apply the concept of division in a slightly more complex context, while also introducing a new element (subtracting toys already in a box).\n\nBy solving this question, you'll continue to reinforce your understanding of the concept and build confidence in your ability to apply it to slightly more challenging problems.",
