      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's response, 42 meters, is incorrect. To determine the correct answer, let's break down the problem. First, we need to find the original perimeter of the garden. Given the length (8 meters) and width (5 meters), we can use the formula P = 2l + 2w:\n\nP = 2(8) + 2(5)\nP = 16 + 10\nP = 26 meters\n\nSince the path increases the perimeter by 4 meters, we add this to the original perimeter:\n\nNew Perimeter = Original Perimeter + Increase\nNew Perimeter = 26 meters + 4 meters\nNew Perimeter = 30 meters\n\nHowever, none of the options match our calculation. Let's re-evaluate the options and consider that the question may have a trick or a different approach. Upon closer inspection, we notice that the options are all higher than our calculated answer, suggesting that the path might be increasing the perimeter by a certain amount on each side.\n\nLet's recalculate the new perimeter, considering the path adds a uniform width on each side. If we assume the path is 1 meter wide, the new dimensions would be 10 meters (8 meters + 2 meters) and 7 meters (5 meters + 2 meters). The new perimeter would be:\n\nNew Perimeter = 2(10) + 2(7)\nNew Perimeter = 20 + 14\nNew Perimeter = 34 meters\n\nHowever, this is still not an option. Let's try another approach. If we assume the path is 2 meters wide, the new dimensions would be 12 meters (8 meters + 4 meters) and 9 meters (5 meters + 4 meters). The new perimeter would be:\n\nNew Perimeter = 2(12) + 2(9)\nNew Perimeter = 24 + 18\nNew Perimeter = 42 meters\n\nThis matches option C) 42 meters, so it seems the student's answer is correct. However, it's essential to note that the question might have been ambiguous, and there could be multiple ways to approach it.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's current level of understanding and the recent question, the next question should continue to challenge them while reinforcing their knowledge.

They correctly applied the formula for the perimeter, which is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. However, they made an error in the calculation. The correct calculation is:\n\nP = 2(l + w)\n= 2(18 + 12)\n= 2(30)\n= 60 meters\n\nThe student's confusion about adding the length and width together and then multiplying by 2 is understandable, but this is not the correct formula for finding the perimeter. The correct formula is to add the length and width together and then multiply the sum by 2.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's current level of understanding and the recent questions, the next question should reinforce their knowledge of the perimeter formula while building their confidence in applying it correctly. Here's a new question that focuses on a simple scenario:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA rectangular pool measures 20 meters in length and 10 meters in width.
