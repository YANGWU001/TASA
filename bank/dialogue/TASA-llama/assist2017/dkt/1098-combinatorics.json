If we want to arrange 6 books on the shelves, and each book can be placed on any shelf, how many different ways can we arrange the books?\n\n**Hint:** Think about the order in which the books are placed, and consider the empty shelves as a possibility.\n\nThis question requires the student to apply basic combinatorial concepts, such as counting and arranging objects. The student needs to consider the order of the books and the empty shelves as a possibility, which will help them understand the concept of permutations and combinations. The question is designed to be challenging yet manageable for a student with a mastery level of approximately 38%.\n\n**Expected learning outcome:**\n\n* The student will be able to understand the concept of arranging objects with repetition and consider the empty shelves as a possibility.\n* The student will be able to apply basic combinatorial concepts, such as counting and arranging objects.\n* The student will be able to identify and correct any misconceptions or errors in their understanding.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n* Provide feedback on the student's answer, highlighting the correct solution and any areas where they may have gone wrong.\n* Encourage the student to explain their thought process and reasoning behind their answer.\n* Use this opportunity to review and reinforce the concepts covered in the question, and provide additional support or resources as needed.",

However, they haven't provided a complete solution yet. It's essential to acknowledge their effort and encourage them to continue thinking critically.\n\nTo provide more guidance, let's break down the problem: we have 6 books and 5 shelves, with each shelf capable of holding 3 books. The student needs to consider how many ways the books can be arranged on the shelves, taking into account that each book can be placed on any shelf.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Combinatorics Practice Question 2:**\n\nA group of friends wants to order pizza. They have 8 different toppings to choose from and want to select 4 toppings for their pizza.

The student will need to apply the formula for combinations, which is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to be chosen.
