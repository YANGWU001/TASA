The correct simplification of 54/108 is to identify the greatest common divisor of 54 and 108, which is 54. Dividing both the numerator and denominator by 54 results in 1/2, not 3/4. The student's attempt to simplify by dividing by 12 or 4 was close, but they didn't find the greatest common divisor. They also incorrectly stated that 54 \u00f7 4 = 13.5.\n\n**What the student did correctly:**\n\n* They multiplied the numerators (9 \u00d7 6 = 54) and the denominators (12 \u00d7 9 = 108) correctly.\n* They attempted to simplify the resulting fraction 54/108.\n\n**What the student needs to work on:**\n\n* Identifying the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator to simplify fractions accurately.\n* Performing accurate division to simplify fractions.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo reinforce the concept of multiplying numerators and denominators separately and to help the student practice simplifying fractions, here's a new question that focuses on finding the greatest common divisor:\n\n**Question:**\n\nFind the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18 and 36.\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1.  It's a fundamental concept that's essential for simplifying fractions.\n2.  The numbers are relatively simple, making it easier for the student to focus on the concept of GCD.\n3.  The question allows the student to practice identifying the GCD of two numbers.\n4.  It's a fundamental building block for more complex fraction-multiplication and simplification problems.\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n\nBy attempting this question, the student will have another chance to demonstrate their understanding of the greatest common divisor and how it applies to simplifying fractions. Their response will help me provide targeted feedback and guidance to address any remaining struggles and build a stronger foundation in fraction-multiplication and simplification.",
