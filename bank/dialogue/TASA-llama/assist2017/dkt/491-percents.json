This is partially correct, as the question indeed involves percents. However, the student didn't provide any further reasoning or thought process about how they would approach the problem. To fully address the question, let's examine the student's understanding.\n\nThe question asks how many cookies Tom will put into the separate container if he wants to put 25% of the 15 cookies into it. To find 25% of 15, the student should multiply 15 by 0.25 (since 25% is equivalent to 0.25). \n\nThe correct answer can be found by multiplying 15 and 0.25, which equals 3.75. However, since we can't have a fraction of a cookie, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. In this case, we can put 3 cookies into the separate container. However, since the options don't include 3.75, and it's a multiple-choice question, we should choose the closest option, which is 3.",
