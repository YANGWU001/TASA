How many pencils will Tom put in the box?\"\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1. **Simple percent calculation**: This question requires the student to apply a basic percent calculation, which is within their current skill level.\n2. **Real-world context**: The scenario is relatable and easy to understand, making it more engaging and accessible.\n3. **Gradual difficulty**: The question starts with a small number of pencils (15) and a relatively simple percent (25%), allowing the student to build confidence and gradually increase their understanding of percents.\n4. **Assesses understanding**: This question will help me gauge the student's ability to apply percent concepts to a simple scenario, identifying areas where they might need additional support.\n\nLet's see how the student performs on this question, and we can adjust the difficulty level and content accordingly to help them improve their understanding of percents!",

They correctly multiplied 240 by 0.03 (which is equivalent to 3%), but then hesitated with their answer. To find the correct answer, we need to calculate 240 x 0.03. Let's do it together: 240 x 0.03 = 7.2. Since we can't have a fraction of a box, we need to round to the nearest whole number. However, 7.2 is closer to 7 than it is to 8.
