Given that the student has shown a low mastery of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents, this question aims to help them recall and apply this concept. The student will need to convert the fraction 1/2 to its decimal equivalent, which is a fundamental skill in the equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents concept.\n\n**Assessment and Feedback:**\n\nAfter the student answers the question, I'll provide feedback on their response, explaining the correct answer (A) 0.5, and highlighting any misconceptions or areas for improvement. This will help the student understand their mistakes and build their confidence in converting fractions to decimals.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nIf the student answers the question correctly, we can proceed to more challenging questions that involve converting between fractions, decimals, and percents. If they struggle, we can revisit the concept and provide additional support to solidify their understanding.\n\nLet's get started!",
