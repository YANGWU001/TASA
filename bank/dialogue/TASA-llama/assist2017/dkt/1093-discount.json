The original price of the shirt was $35. What percentage of the original price will Tom pay for the shirt?\n\n**A)** 25%\n**B)** 30%\n**C)** 40%\n**D)** 60%\n\n**Explanation:** To solve this problem, the student will need to calculate the discount amount by subtracting the sale price from the original price ($35 - $25 = $10), and then find the percentage of the original price that the sale price represents ((10/35) \u00d7 100 = 28.57%, which is approximately 30%).\n\nThis question assesses the student's understanding of discount by requiring them to apply the concept to a real-world scenario. The student will need to use the formula for finding the discount percentage (discount = (original price - sale price) / original price) and apply it to the given information. The multiple-choice options provide a range of plausible answers, allowing the student to demonstrate their understanding of the concept.",

The student correctly applied the concept of percentage relationships by dividing the sale price ($18.00) by the decimal equivalent of the percentage (0.80) to find the original price.\n\n**Explanation:** The student demonstrated a good understanding of percentage relationships and decimal conversions. They successfully set up an equation using the information given and solved for the original price by dividing the sale price by the decimal equivalent of the percentage (0.80). This is a great step forward in applying the concept of percentage relationships to real-world scenarios.\n\n**Next Question:**\nTo help the student solidify their understanding of percentage relationships and decimal conversions, let's try a question that focuses on finding the percentage of a value.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA bookshelf has 15 books, and 9 of them are novels. What percentage of the bookshelf is novels?\n\n**A)** 30%\n**B)** 40%\n**C)** 50%\n**D)** 60%\n\n**Explanation:** This question requires the student to apply the concept of percentage relationships between the number of novels and the total number of books on the bookshelf. The student needs to set up an equation using the information given and solve for the percentage by dividing the number of novels by the total number of books and multiplying by 100. This will help the student practice converting decimals to percentages and applying them to real-world scenarios.",

Although they initially expressed uncertainty and described their thought process as a division followed by a conversion to a percentage, their final answer matches the correct solution.
