The student correctly multiplied the numerators (2 \u00d7 3) and denominators (4 \u00d7 6), which gives us (2 \u00d7 3) / (4 \u00d7 6) = 6 / 24. However, the student was unsure about their answer and provided an alternative, but the correct simplification of 6/24 is not 1/6. To simplify, we need to find the greatest common divisor of 6 and 24, which is 6. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 6, we get (6 \u00f7 6) / (24 \u00f7 6) = 1 / 4. So, the correct answer is indeed 1/4, not 1/6. The student demonstrated a good attempt at multiplying the fractions, but struggled with simplifying the result.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nGiven the student's current level of understanding, the next question will help build on the concept of fraction multiplication by introducing a scenario that involves comparing the complexity of fractions with a simpler denominator.\n\nQuestion: 1/2 \u00d7 2/3 = ?\n\nThis question:\n\n1.  **Reviews the multiplication of fractions**: This question continues to reinforce the concept of multiplying fractions by using a new set of numbers.\n2.  **Introduces comparing fractions after multiplication with simpler denominators**: The question involves multiplying fractions with relatively simple denominators, which will help the student practice comparing fractions and become more confident in their calculations.\n3.  **Provides an opportunity to apply the concept**: This question will help the student demonstrate their understanding of fraction multiplication and identify areas where they need additional practice or review.\n\nTake your time, and let's work through this problem together!",
