      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYour answer to the question about the water bottle is a good effort, but there are a few small mistakes. Let's break it down together. You correctly calculated the first discount: 15% of $10 is $1.50, so the sale price is $10 - $1.50 = $8.50.\n\nHowever, when calculating the second discount, you used 10% of $8.50, which is correct. You got 10% of $8.50 as $0.85, and then subtracted this from $8.50 to get $7.65. This is actually the correct answer! I was worried you might be rounding incorrectly, but your math is spot on.\n\nThe reason you didn't see $7.65 as an option is that it's a precise calculation. In real-world scenarios, prices are often rounded to two decimal places, so $7.65 would be rounded to $7.65, but also to $7.66 or $7.64, depending on the context. But in this case, your precise calculation is the correct answer.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering your recent performance and areas for improvement, I'll provide a question that targets your understanding of finding percents in a different context.

Let's break it down together. The question asks for the final price of a bicycle that's initially priced at $80, with a 15% discount followed by a 10% discount on the sale price.\n\nYou know that to find the sale price after the 15% discount, you need to calculate 15% of $80 and subtract it from $80. 15% of $80 is $12, so the sale price is $80 - $12 = $68.\n\nHowever, the next step is where it seems you got stuck. You need to apply a 10% discount to the sale price of $68. To do this, you need to calculate 10% of $68. 10% of $68 is $6.80. Then, you subtract $6.80 from $68 to get the final price.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the options match your calculation, and you're not sure what to do.

However, let's take a closer look at your calculation. You correctly found the sale price after the 20% discount by subtracting $5 from the original price of $25, resulting in a sale price of $20.\n\nThen, you attempted to apply the 5% discount to the sale price. You correctly calculated 5% of $20 as $1. However, the issue lies in the next step. When applying the discount, you should subtract the discount amount from the sale price, not the original price. So, you should subtract $1 from $20, not $25.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is: $20 - $1 = $19. Your initial guess of $20 (option B) is actually the sale price after the 20% discount, not the final price after the second discount.

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYou've made an effort to solve the problem, and your thought process is clear. However, let's take a closer look at your calculation. You correctly found the sale price after the 10% discount by subtracting $4 from the original price of $40, resulting in a sale price of $36.\n\nThen, you attempted to apply the 5% discount to the sale price. You correctly calculated 5% of $36 as $1.80, not $2. However, when applying the discount, you should subtract the discount amount from the sale price. So, you should subtract $1.80 from $36, not $2.\n\nTherefore, the correct calculation is: $36 - $1.80 = $34.20. Unfortunately, your initial guess of $33 (option A) is incorrect, and your other calculation of $34 is close but not quite accurate.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering your recent performance and areas for improvement, I'll provide a question that targets your understanding of finding percents in a different context.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nThe original price of the toy car is $48. You need to find the sale price after a 15% discount. To do this, you should multiply the original price by 0.15 (which is equivalent to 15%) and subtract the result from the original price.\n\n15% of $48 = 0.15 \u00d7 $48 = $7.20\n\nNow, subtract the discount amount from the original price:\n\n$48 - $7.20 = $40.80\n\nThis is the sale price after the 15% discount. However, you didn't continue with the next step, which is to apply a 10% discount on the sale price.\n\nTo do this, you should multiply the sale price by 0.10 (which is equivalent to 10%) and subtract the result from the sale price:\n\n10% of $40.80 = 0.10 \u00d7 $40.80 = $4.08\n\nNow, subtract the discount amount from the sale price:\n\n$40.80 - $4.08 = $36.72\n\nUnfortunately, none of the options match this result.
