The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 8 and 16 is indeed 8, which the student correctly identified. However, when simplifying the fraction, they should have divided both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD, resulting in 1/2, not 2/4.\n\nTo simplify the fraction 8/16, the student should have divided the numerator (8 \u00f7 8 = 1) and the denominator (16 \u00f7 8 = 2) by their GCD, 8. This would yield the correct simplified form, 1/2.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help the student build on their existing knowledge and address their simplification error, the next question will focus on simplifying fractions with a common factor, emphasizing the importance of finding the correct greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n**Question:**\n\nWhat is the simplified form of the fraction 20/40?\n\nA) 1/2\nB) 2/4\nC) 1/4\nD) 2/5\nE) 1/5\n\n**Explanation and Hints:**\n\nTo solve this problem, the student should look for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 40.
