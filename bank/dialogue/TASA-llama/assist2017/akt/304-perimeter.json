What is its perimeter?\n\n**Expected Response:**\nTo create a question that is at the student's current level, I will provide the exact formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, and include a simple numerical example. The student's goal is to apply this formula to find the perimeter of the garden.\n\n**Question Options:**\nA) P = 2l + 2w\nB) P = lw\nC) P = l - w\nD) P = l + w\n\n**Correct Answer:**\nA) P = 2l + 2w\n\n**Helpful Hints:**\n- The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width.\n- To find the perimeter, we need to multiply the length and width by 2 and add them together.\n\nThis question will assess the student's understanding of the perimeter formula and their ability to apply it to a simple example. The question is not too difficult, given their current level of mastery, but challenging enough to help them build their confidence and understanding of the concept.",

The formula you selected, **B) P = lw**, is actually the formula for the area of a rectangle, not the perimeter. To find the area of a rectangle, we multiply the length and width together. However, to find the perimeter, we need to use a different formula, which we discussed earlier: **P = 2l + 2w**. This formula adds the lengths of all the sides of the rectangle together to find the total distance around it.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nNow that we've practiced with a simple example, let's try another one that's slightly more challenging.

You're on the right track by considering the relationship between the length, width, and perimeter, but you're still mixing up the formula. The correct formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where you need to multiply both the length and the width by 2 and add them together. In this case, the correct calculation would be 2(12) + 2(8) = 24 + 16 = 40 meters. Your answer, P = 2(12) + 8, is close, but you're missing the second multiplication by 2 for the width. You're correct that multiplying the length by 2 gives you 24, but you need to multiply the width by 2 as well, which would give you 16, and then add those two numbers together to get the perimeter.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nNow that we've practiced with a few examples, let's try a question that will help you solidify the perimeter formula. Here it is:\n\nA rectangle has a length of 15 meters and a width of 6 meters. What is its perimeter?\n\n**Question Options:**\n\nA) P = 2(15 + 6)\nB) P = 2(15) + 2(6)\nC) P = 15 + 6\nD) P = 2(15) + 6\n\n**Correct Answer:**\nThe correct answer will be the one that correctly applies the perimeter formula, P = 2l + 2w.\n\n**Helpful Hints:**\n\n- Remember, the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w.\n- To find the perimeter, we need to multiply the length and width by 2 and add them together.\n- Make sure to use the correct order of operations: multiply the numbers by 2 first, then add them together.\n\nThis question will help you practice applying the perimeter formula to a new scenario, and I'm here to guide you through it.",
