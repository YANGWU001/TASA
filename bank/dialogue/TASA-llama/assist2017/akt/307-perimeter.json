What is the perimeter of the rectangle?\n\nA) 10 cm\nB) 12 cm\nC) 16 cm\nD) 20 cm\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n- This question assesses the student's basic understanding of perimeter by asking them to apply the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.\n- The numbers are relatively simple and easy to manage for a student with a weak grasp of perimeter.\n- This question encourages the student to recall the formula and apply it to a straightforward scenario, helping them regain confidence in their understanding.\n\n**Additional guidance:**\nAfter the student attempts this question, I would review the correct answer, explaining the concept of perimeter and the formula. We would then work through the solution together, ensuring the student understands how to apply the formula to find the perimeter of a rectangle.",

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated using the formula P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. Given that the length (l) is 6 cm and the width (w) is 4 cm, we plug these values into the formula: P = 2(6) + 2(4) = 12 + 8 = 20. However, you correctly applied the formula to find the perimeter, which is 2(6) + 2(4) = 12 + 8 = 20 cm. But, then you selected the wrong answer. The correct answer is actually **D) 20 cm**.

What is the perimeter of the rectangle?\n\nA) 38 cm\nB) 46 cm\nC) 58 cm\nD) 68 cm\n\n**Why this question:**\n- This question assesses your ability to apply the perimeter formula for a rectangle with larger numbers and different dimensions.\n- The numbers are slightly more challenging than the previous question, but still manageable for someone with a solid grasp of the formula.\n- This question encourages you to recall and apply the formula in a new scenario, helping you solidify your understanding of the concept.\n\nTake your time, and remember to apply the formula correctly.",

Your calculation, P = 2(15) + 2(8) = 30 + 16 = 46 cm, was initially incorrect, but you corrected it by selecting the correct answer choice, **A) 38 cm**. However, the correct perimeter is actually 46 cm, not 38 cm. It seems you made a calculation mistake initially, but you were able to catch the error and choose the correct answer.
