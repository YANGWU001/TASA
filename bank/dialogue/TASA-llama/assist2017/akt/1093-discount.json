She has a 15% discount coupon. If she uses the coupon, how much will she pay for the game?\n\nA) $48\nB) $51\nC) $54\nD) $57\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1.  This question is a simple, straightforward discount calculation that aligns with the student's current knowledge level.\n2.  It uses a concrete example with a specific discount percentage (15%), which is easy to understand and calculate.\n3.  The student has to apply the discount concept to a real-world scenario, which helps build problem-solving skills.\n4.  The options are close enough to each other, making it challenging but not overwhelming for the student.\n5.  This question is a great opportunity for the student to demonstrate their understanding of the discount concept and apply it to a simple problem.\n\n**Grading and feedback:**\n\n*   If the student answers correctly, provide feedback on their calculation and encourage them to try more challenging problems.\n*   If the student answers incorrectly, provide a gentle correction, explaining the correct calculation and encouraging them to try again.",

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's answer, **$39.20**, is correct. They correctly applied the concept of multiple discounts to find the final price of the toy. First, they found the initial discount of 12% of $45, which is $5.40. Then, they subtracted this amount from the original price to get $39.60. Next, they found the second discount of 3% of $39.60, which is $1.188, and subtracted this amount from the price after the first discount to get $38.412. Rounding this to the nearest cent, the student arrived at the correct final price of $38.41, which is closest to **option A) $39.20**. However, there seems to be a small calculation error. \n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help the student further solidify their understanding of the discount concept, let's try a new question that's a bit more challenging.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA store is having a sale on a sweater, offering a 15% discount on the original price. If the sweater originally costs $60, and you also get a 5% discount on the discounted price, how much will you pay for the sweater?\n\nA) $47.40\nB) $48.50\nC) $49.00\nD) $50.00\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1.  This question builds on the student's understanding of single and multiple discounts.\n2.  It requires the student to apply the discount concept to a scenario with a moderate discount percentage (15%), which will help them develop problem-solving skills.\n3.  The student has to calculate two discounts in sequence, which will help them understand how discounts compound.\n4.  The options are close enough to each other, making it challenging but not overwhelming for the student.\n5.  This question will help the student demonstrate their understanding of the discount concept in a more complex scenario.\n\n**Grading and feedback:**\n\n*   If the student answers correctly, provide feedback on their calculation and encourage them to try more challenging problems.\n*   If the student answers incorrectly, provide a gentle correction, explaining the correct calculation and encouraging them to try again.",
