The student will need to apply the concept of choosing items from a set without regard to order, which is a fundamental idea in combinatorics.

They correctly multiplied the number of choices for each pencil (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 60) and then divided by the number of ways to arrange 3 items (3! = 6), which is a good approach to find the number of combinations.\n\nHowever, the student seems to have made a mistake in their calculation. Instead of dividing 60 by 6, they mentioned dividing by 3! (6), but then also mentioned the two red pencils, which seems to be a distraction. The correct calculation is simply 60 \u00f7 6 = 10.\n\n**Encouragement and Feedback:**\n\nDon't worry, you were close, and your approach was correct. The key takeaway is that you need to be more careful with your calculations. Remember, the order of the pencils doesn't matter, so you're on the right track with the combination formula.
