The fractions involved are relatively simple (2/4 and 3/6), making it easier for the student to focus on the multiplication concept rather than getting bogged down by complex fractions.\n2.  The question doesn't require the student to multiply two fractions with different denominators, which would add an extra layer of complexity.\n3.  The question allows the student to practice multiplying numerators and denominators separately, which is a fundamental concept in fraction multiplication.\n\n**Assessment goals:**\n\n1.  Does the student understand the concept of multiplying numerators and denominators separately?\n2.  Can the student apply this understanding to a simple fraction multiplication problem?\n3.  Will this question help the student regain confidence in their ability to multiply fractions?\n\nLet's see how the student does!",

However, when simplifying the fraction, the student identified a common factor of 2 between 5 and 16, which is not entirely accurate. The factor of 2 is indeed present in 16, but it's not present in 5. The correct simplification is that 5 and 16 do not share a common factor other than 1.\n\nA better approach would be to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5 and 16, which is 1. Since the GCD is 1, the fraction cannot be simplified further. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed \\(\\frac{5}{16}\\).\n\nThe student's process was mostly correct, showing improvement in their understanding of fraction multiplication, but there's room for further refinement in simplifying fractions.\n\n**Next question tailored to the student's current knowledge state:**\n\n**Question:**\n\n3/4 \u00d7 1/2 = ?\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1.  This question involves multiplying two fractions with a moderate degree of difficulty, which will help the student apply their understanding of multiplying numerators and denominators to a new set of fractions.\n2.  The question requires the student to multiply the numerators and denominators, which they demonstrated an understanding of in the previous question.\n3.  The resulting fraction will have a numerator that is a multiple of 3 and a denominator that is a multiple of 2, making it easier for the student to multiply and check their answer.\n\n**Assessment goals:**\n\n1.  Can the student apply their understanding of multiplying numerators and denominators to a new fraction multiplication problem?\n2.  Will the student be able to multiply the fractions correctly?\n3.  Will this question help the student build confidence in their ability to multiply fractions?\n\nThis question will also help the student practice multiplying fractions with different denominators, which is an essential skill for more complex fraction operations.",
