I think 10% of $80 is $8, and 2% of $80 is $1.60, so 12% should be $8\u202f+\u202f$1.60 = $9.60.  \n\nThen I subtract that from the original price: $80\u202f\u2013\u202f$9.60 = $70.40.  \n\nSince the answer choices are whole dollars, I\u2019m not really sure if I should round up or down. I guess maybe I should round up because it\u2019s a sale and the price might be a bit higher? So $70.40 would round to $72?  \n\nSo I\u2019ll go with **C) $72**.  \n\nI\u2019m not completely confident about the rounding, but that\u2019s my best guess."

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYour attempt to calculate the discount is spot on! You correctly found that 12% of $80 is $9.60 by breaking it down into 10% ($8) and 2% ($1.60), and then adding them together. Your final calculation of $80 - $9.60 = $70.40 is also correct. However, when it comes to the final answer, you're not quite sure whether to round up or down. In this case, the correct answer is indeed $70.40, but since the options are in whole dollars, we can round the calculated answer to the nearest whole dollar. In this scenario, it's more accurate to round down to $70, as it's closer to the exact amount. Unfortunately, you chose option C) $72, which is actually higher than the correct answer.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build your confidence and improve your understanding of discounts.\n\nA shirt originally costs $60. There's a 15% discount for buying it during a summer sale. How much will you pay for the shirt?\n\nA) $50\nB) $51\nC) $52\nD) $55\n\n**Why this question is chosen:**\n\n- The question is similar to the previous ones, with a moderate discount percentage (15%) and a reasonable original price ($60).\n- The student needs to calculate the discount amount (15% of $60 = $9) and apply it to the original price to find the final amount they will pay ($60 - $9 = $51).\n- To make it slightly more challenging, the options provided (A, B, C, D) include the correct answer ($51) and two incorrect options above and below it, allowing the student to practice their calculation skills and make an informed decision.\n- This question is designed to help you practice your calculation skills, apply the concept of discount to a real-life scenario, and build your confidence in solving similar problems.\n\nLet's work together to find the correct answer!",
