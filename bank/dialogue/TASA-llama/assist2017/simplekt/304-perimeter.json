The student correctly added the length and width (6 cm + 4 cm = 10 cm) but then incorrectly counted only one side of each length and width.

The correct calculation is 2 \u00d7 (6 + 4) = 2 \u00d7 10 = 20 cm, but since the student added an extra 2 cm, they thought the correct answer was 22 cm.

Then, they should have divided both sides by 2, which indeed gives them 6 = length. However, they incorrectly stated that the length is 6 cm. \n\nTo find the length, we need to isolate the length term. Let's re-evaluate the equation: 16 = 2 \u00d7 (length + 2). We can start by dividing both sides by 2: 8 = length + 2. Then, subtract 2 from both sides: 6 = length.\n\n**Next Question:**\nTo help the student solidify their understanding of the perimeter formula and build confidence in solving for unknown dimensions, let's try a question that focuses on a similar concept.

What is the width of the rectangle?\n\n**A)** 4 cm\n**B)** 5 cm\n**C)** 6 cm\n**D)** 8 cm\n\n**Answer:** The correct answer is A) 4 cm.\n\n**Explanation:** To solve this problem, the student can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2 \u00d7 (length + width). We know the perimeter is 24 cm and the length is 8 cm. Let's plug in the values we know: 24 = 2 \u00d7 (8 + width). To find the width, we need to solve for the width.
