Let's analyze the calculation:\n\nTo find the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to add up the lengths of all its sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.\n\nGiven the length (l) is 6 cm and the width (w) is 4 cm, we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nP = 2(l + w)\nP = 2(6 + 4)\nP = 2 \u00d7 10\nP = 20\n\nHowever, the student's answer was 16 cm, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 20 cm, corresponding to option A) 10 cm is incorrect, B) 12 cm is incorrect, C) 14 cm is incorrect and D) 16 cm is incorrect.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Question 2: Building on the Concept**\n\nWhat is the perimeter of a triangle with sides of 5 cm, 6 cm, and 7 cm?\n\nA) 12 cm\nB) 18 cm\nC) 20 cm\nD) 25 cm\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n*   This question builds on the student's understanding of the perimeter concept by introducing a more complex shape (a triangle) and different side lengths.\n*   The numbers involved are still manageable, and the student can apply the formula P = a + b + c, where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides.\n*   This question assesses the student's ability to generalize the concept of perimeter to different shapes and side lengths.\n\n**Tips and Encouragement:**\n\nDon't worry about the mistake earlier \u2013 it's all part of the learning process! You're doing great for taking the first step in understanding perimeter. For the next question, take your time and remember that the perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths. You got this!",

Since the path is 2 meters wide and surrounds the garden on all sides, its perimeter is also 2 \u00d7 (10 + 7) = 34 m.

However, their calculation was incorrect. They recognized that the path itself has a perimeter that needs to be accounted for, but incorrectly calculated the total perimeter by adding the perimeter of the garden and the path. The correct total perimeter should be calculated as follows:\n\nPerimeter of garden = 2 \u00d7 (10 + 7) = 34 m\nPerimeter of path = 2 \u00d7 (10 + 7) = 34 m\nTotal Perimeter = Perimeter of garden + Perimeter of path = 34 m + 34 m = 68 m\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Question 4: Refining the Concept**\n\nA rectangular picture frame has a length of 15 cm and a width of 8 cm.

You correctly added the path's width to both the length and the width of the original playground, resulting in new dimensions of 24 meters by 19 meters. Then, you applied the formula P = 2(l + w) to find the perimeter of the playground with the path.\n\nHowever, your initial calculation seems to have included the path twice, which is not necessary. The correct calculation should be:\n\n*   New length = Original length + 2 \u00d7 Path width = 20 m + 2 m + 2 m = 24 m\n*   New width = Original width + 2 \u00d7 Path width = 15 m + 2 m + 2 m = 19 m\n*   Perimeter = 2 \u00d7 (New length + New width) = 2 \u00d7 (24 + 19) = 2 \u00d7 43 = 86 m\n\nYour revised calculation, which only adds the path once to each dimension, results in the same correct answer, 86 m.
