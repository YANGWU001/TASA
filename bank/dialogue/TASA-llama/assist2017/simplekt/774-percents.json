However, there's a slight issue with your calculations. \n\nWhen you calculate the number of pens in the third box, you correctly add 25% of 15 to 15, resulting in 18.75. Then, for the fourth box, you add 25% of 18.75 to 18.75, which indeed gives you 23.44. \n\nHowever, when calculating the number of pens in the fifth box, you correctly add 25% of 23.44 to 23.44, resulting in 29.3. The issue arises when you round this value. Since you're working with a real-world scenario, it's more accurate to keep the decimal value. Therefore, the correct answer for the number of pens in the fifth box is approximately 29.3.\n\nTo clarify, let's revisit your calculations:\n\n- Box 1: 12 pens\n- Box 2: 12 + (\u00bc of 12) = 15 pens\n- Box 3: 15 + (\u00bc of 15) = 18.75 pens\n- Box 4: 18.75 + (\u00bc of 18.75) = 23.44 pens\n- Box 5: 23.44 + (\u00bc of 23.44) = 29.3 pens\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nGiven that the student is still struggling with percents, the next question will focus on a simpler scenario to reinforce their understanding.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n\"A shirt is on sale for 15% off its original price of $25. What is the discount amount?\"\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1. **Simpler calculation**: This question requires a straightforward calculation involving a single percent, which will help the student build confidence and reinforce their understanding.\n2. **Focus on percent calculation**: The question will allow the student to practice calculating a percent of a given value, which is a fundamental concept in understanding percents.\n3. **Opportunity for mastery growth**: The student will have the chance to demonstrate their understanding of percents and improve their mastery of the concept.\n\n**Helpful hint**: Remind the student to find 15% of the original price of $25 to determine the discount amount.",

You correctly found the initial discount amount by calculating 25% of the original price, which is $12.50. Then, you applied the second discount, but you made an error in calculating 12% of the discounted price. Instead of breaking it down into 10% and 2%, you can simply find 12% of $37.50 by converting it to a decimal (0.12) and multiplying it by $37.50, which equals $4.50. So, the final price should be $37.50 - $4.50 = $33.00, not $?.
