If he divides it equally into 2 parts, how many equal parts will each friend get?\"\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1.  Build on the student's existing knowledge of fractions (1/2).\n2.  Introduce the concept of dividing a fraction into equal parts.\n3.  Use a real-world scenario to make the problem more relatable and engaging.\n4.  Assess the student's ability to multiply a fraction by a whole number (1/2 \u00d7 2).\n\nThis question should help the student develop a basic understanding of fraction-multiplication and build their confidence before moving on to more complex problems.",

When Tom divides \u00bd of the pizza into 2 equal parts, each part will be \u00bc of the pizza. Your understanding of fractions is a good starting point for fraction-multiplication.\n\nTo break it down, when you multiply a fraction by a whole number, you're essentially repeating the fraction that many times. In this case, multiplying \u00bd by 2 means you're splitting the original \u00bd into 2 equal parts. Each part will be \u00bc of the pizza. So, your answer is correct, and you're on the right track!\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n\"Sarah has 3/4 of a bag of apples that she wants to share with her 4 friends.

So, you should multiply the numerator (3) by 4, which gives you 12, and keep the denominator (4) the same. This results in 12/4, which simplifies to 3.

      "content": "**Explanation of Student's Last Answer**\n\nYou're close, but not quite there yet. Your reasoning is correct in that Tom has 2/5 of a pizza and wants to share it with 2 friends. However, you're still struggling with the concept of dividing a fraction into smaller parts. To find out how many slices each friend will get, you should multiply the fraction 2/5 by 2, which represents the number of friends. This means you should multiply the numerator (2) by 2, resulting in 4, and keep the denominator (5) the same.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 2 = \\frac{4}{5} \\). This means each friend will get 4/5 of the pizza. To find out the number of slices each friend will get, you should divide the numerator (4) by the denominator (5), which equals 4/5.\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nTo help you solidify your understanding of dividing fractions by whole numbers, let's try a new scenario:\n\n\"Alex has 3/6 of a bag of candy that she wants to share with 4 friends. If she divides the candy equally among them, how many pieces will each friend get?\"\n\nThis question uses a smaller denominator (6) and a smaller whole number (4) to make it more manageable. It also introduces the concept of dividing a fraction by a larger number, which will help you practice your skills in a more challenging scenario.",

To find out how many pieces each friend will get, you should multiply the fraction 3/6 by 4, which represents the number of friends.

Since the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 12 and 6 is 6, you can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 6, resulting in \\( \\frac{12}{6} = \\frac{2}{1} \\) or simply 2.

Your reasoning is correct in that Emily has 1/4 of a bag of apples and wants to share it with 3 friends. However, you're still struggling with the concept of dividing a fraction into smaller parts. To find out how many pieces each friend will get, you should multiply the fraction 1/4 by 3, which represents the number of friends. This means you should multiply the numerator (1) by 3, resulting in 3, and keep the denominator (4) the same.\n\nSo, the correct calculation is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times 3 = \\frac{3}{4} \\). This means each friend will get 3/4 of a piece of the bag, but since you're dividing the apples equally among them, you need to think about how many parts each friend will get, not just the fraction of the bag.\n\nTo find the number of pieces each friend will get, you can divide the numerator (3) by the denominator (4), but that would mean each friend gets 3/4 of a piece. Instead, think about the total number of parts the bag is divided into (4) and how many friends are sharing (3). Since you can't divide a piece into fractions, you should think about how many whole pieces each friend can get, which would be 3/4 of a piece.\n\nLet's try to rephrase it in a simpler way: if you have 4 pieces of a pizza and you want to share it among 3 friends, each friend will get 1 piece. However, in this case, you have 4 pieces of a bag and you want to share it among 3 friends, so each friend will get a bit more than 1 piece, which is 3/4 of a piece. To find out how many pieces each friend will get, you should think about how many pieces each friend will get, not just the fraction of the bag.\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nTo help you solidify your understanding of dividing fractions by whole numbers, let's try a new scenario:\n\n\"Max has 2/8 of a bag of marbles that he wants to share with 2 friends.
