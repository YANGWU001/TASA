The correct answer is A) 180 degrees. The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is a fundamental property that can be easily remembered using the phrase \"180 degrees.\" This concept is essential in geometry, and understanding it will help the student solve various problems involving triangles.\n\n**Why is the sum of interior angles of a triangle 180 degrees?**\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees because when you draw a triangle, the three angles inside the triangle add up to a straight line, which is 180 degrees. This is a basic property of triangles that can be easily visualized using a straight line or by drawing a triangle and measuring the angles.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nGiven the student's current knowledge state, the next question will build on their understanding of the sum of interior angles of a triangle. Here's a question that will help them solidify their understanding:\n\n**Question 2: Short Answer**\n\nA triangle has two angles that measure 60 degrees and 70 degrees. What is the measure of the third angle?\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1. **Building on previous knowledge**: This question requires the student to apply their understanding of the sum of interior angles of a triangle to a new scenario.\n2. **Real-world application**: The student will have to use the concept in a practical way, which will help them retain the information better.\n3. **Opportunity to practice calculation**: The student will need to calculate the measure of the third angle, which will help them develop their problem-solving skills.\n4. **Assesses understanding**: By solving this problem, the student will demonstrate their ability to apply the concept of the sum of interior angles of a triangle to a real-world scenario.\n\nLet's see how the student responds to this question!",

The sum of interior angles of a triangle is actually **180 degrees**, not 360 degrees. This is a common misconception, and it's essential to clarify this concept.\n\nThe student's answer of 360 degrees might be due to confusing the sum of interior angles of a polygon (like a quadrilateral or pentagon) with the sum of interior angles of a triangle. Remember, the sum of interior angles of a polygon is (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. However, this formula doesn't apply to triangles.\n\n**Encouragement**\n\nDon't worry, it's a common mistake!
