By converting a fraction to a decimal, we're assessing their understanding of the concept.\n2. **Simple fraction:** The fraction 3/8 is a relatively simple one, which will allow the student to apply their existing knowledge and build confidence.\n3. **Low-stakes question:** This question is a low-stakes assessment, allowing the student to focus on the concept without feeling overwhelmed by a high-stakes question.\n4. **Building blocks for decimals and percents:** Once the student masters this question, we can gradually introduce more complex concepts, such as converting decimals to fractions or percentages.\n\n**Answer options:**\n\nA) 0.25\nB) 0.375\nC) 0.5\nD) 0.625\n\n**Expected answer:** B) 0.375",

What is the equivalent decimal for the fraction 7/8?\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1. **Fraction to decimal conversion:** This question targets the same concept as the previous questions, allowing the student to reinforce their understanding.\n2. **Challenging fraction:** The fraction 7/8 is a bit more challenging than 2/8, making it a great opportunity for the student to apply their knowledge in a slightly more complex scenario.\n3. **Building blocks for decimals and percents:** Once the student masters this question, we can gradually introduce more complex concepts, such as converting decimals to fractions or percentages.\n4. **Gradual increase in difficulty:** By gradually increasing the difficulty of the questions, we can help the student build confidence and develop a deeper understanding of equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents.\n\n**Answer options:**\n\nA) 0.5\nB) 0.6\nC) 0.75\nD) 0.9\n\n**Expected answer:** C) 0.875",
