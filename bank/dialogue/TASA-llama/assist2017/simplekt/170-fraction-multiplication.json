You correctly multiplied the numerators (2 \u00d7 5 = 10) and the denominators (3 \u00d7 6 = 18), resulting in 10/18. However, you made an error when you wrote 10/12 instead of 10/18. To simplify the fraction 10/18, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 18. The GCD of 10 and 18 is 2. So, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2, resulting in 5/9.\n\nThe correct answer is **B) 5/9**.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven your current knowledge level and understanding of fraction-multiplication, I'd like to present a question that builds upon your previous experience.
