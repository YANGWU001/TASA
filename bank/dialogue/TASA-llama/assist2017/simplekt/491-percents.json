The student should recall that to find a percentage of a number, they need to multiply the number by the percentage (in decimal form). In this case, 25% is equivalent to 0.25. The correct answer is 30 (120 * 0.25 = 30).\n\nThis question is a good starting point because:\n\n1. It's a basic concept that the student should have a basic understanding of.\n2. It's a simple calculation that doesn't require complex thinking.\n3. It allows the student to practice converting a percentage to a decimal, a crucial skill for percent calculations.\n\nBy answering this question, the student will demonstrate their understanding of finding percents and help build their confidence in this area.",
