This time, we'll introduce a twist: the discount is given as a percentage off the original price, and you need to find the original price.\n\n**Question:** A bookstore is offering a 20% discount on all books. If a book is on sale for $8, what was the original price of the book?\n\n**Answer choices:**\n\nA) $8\nB) $10\nC) $12\nD) $16\n\n**Explanation:** This question requires you to apply your understanding of percentages to a real-world scenario. You need to set up a proportion or use the formula: original price = sale price / (1 - discount percentage). This will help you understand how to apply percentages to different types of problems and think critically about the relationships between numbers.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\n\n* To apply percentages to real-world scenarios\n* To find the original price given the sale price and discount percentage\n* To solidify understanding of decimal to percentage conversions and proportions\n\n**Estimated Difficulty Level:** 6/10 (moderate)\n\n**Time:** Allow yourself 1-2 minutes to complete the question.\n\nTake your time, and remember that you can always ask for help if you're unsure.",

Instead, you should use the formula: original price = sale price / (1 - discount percentage). In this case, the discount percentage is 20%, which as a decimal is 0.20.

You attempted to apply your understanding of percentages by considering the discount amount, which is a good start. However, you didn't use the correct formula to find the original price. The correct approach would be to use the formula: original price = sale price / (1 - discount percentage). In this case, the discount percentage is 25%, which as a decimal is 0.25.
