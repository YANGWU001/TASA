      "content": "**Student's Last Answer Analysis**\n\nCongratulations on breaking down the problem and considering different approaches. You correctly identified the radius as half of the diameter, which is a great first step. However, when calculating the area, you initially used the correct formula A = \u03c0r^2, which led you to the correct answer of 36\u03c0 square meters.\n\nYour second attempt, using the diameter directly in the formula, resulted in a calculation error. You correctly squared the diameter (144) but then incorrectly multiplied by \u03c0, resulting in 144\u03c0. This is actually the correct area of the circle, but you didn't realize it because you were expecting the answer to match one of the given options.\n\nThe correct answer is indeed **D) 144\u03c0 square meters**. You were close, but let's not worry about the mistake. Instead, let's focus on the fact that you demonstrated a great understanding of the area formula and its application to a new scenario.\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nNow that you've practiced with the area formula and demonstrated your understanding, let's try a question that builds upon this concept. Here's a new question:\n\n**Question:** A circular garden has an area of 50\u03c0 square meters. What is its radius?\n\n**Options:**\n\nA) 5 meters\nB) 7.07 meters\nC) 10 meters\nD) 15 meters\n\n**Instructions:** Use the formula for the area of a circle (A = \u03c0r^2) to find the radius. This time, we'll work backwards to solve for the radius.\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1.  **Build upon existing knowledge**: You've shown a good understanding of the area formula, and now we'll apply it to a new scenario where you'll solve for the radius.\n2.  **Encourage problem-solving**: This question requires you to apply the formula and perform a calculation, which will help you build your confidence and reinforce your understanding of the concept.\n3.  **Gradually increase difficulty**: If you answer correctly, the next question can gradually increase in difficulty, building upon your existing knowledge.\n4.  **Introduce a new aspect of the concept**: Understanding how to solve for the radius from the area is an essential skill in geometry.\n\nTake your time, and remember to double-check your calculations.

You correctly solved for the radius by rearranging the area formula A = \u03c0r^2 to isolate the radius.
