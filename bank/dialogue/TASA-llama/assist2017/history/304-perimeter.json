Here's a question tailored to their needs:\n\n**Question:** \n\nA rectangular garden has a length of 6 meters and a width of 4 meters. What is its perimeter?\n\n**Visual Aid:** You can draw a simple rectangle with the given dimensions or provide a text-based representation like:\n```\n  +-----------+\n  |         |\n  |  6m  4m  |\n  |         |\n  +-----------+\n```\n**Why this question?**\n\n1.  The student has a low mastery level (~33%) and a high forgetting score (0.46), indicating a need for a refresher on the concept.\n2.  The question is straightforward and requires basic understanding of the perimeter formula (P = 2l + 2w), which is a fundamental concept in geometry.\n3.  The problem uses a simple, concrete scenario (a garden) to make it relatable and easier to understand.\n4.  The student can apply the formula directly to the given dimensions, allowing them to practice and reinforce their understanding of the concept.\n\n**Assessment and Feedback:**\n\nAfter the student attempts the question, provide feedback and guidance to help them understand their mistakes and build upon their existing knowledge. If they struggle, consider breaking down the problem into smaller steps or providing additional explanations to reinforce their understanding.\n\nBy starting with this question, you can help the student regain a solid foundation in the perimeter concept and build their confidence in applying it to various problems.",

You correctly broke down the problem by adding the length and width sides, getting 12 meters and 8 meters, respectively. However, when calculating the perimeter, we need to multiply each side by 2 and then add them together. So, the correct calculation is:\n\nPerimeter (P) = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n= 2 \u00d7 (6 + 4)\n= 2 \u00d7 10\n= 20 meters\n\nYou might have added the two lengths (6 + 6) and two widths (4 + 4) together, which would indeed give you 24 meters. But in perimeter calculations, we need to multiply the sum of the lengths and widths by 2, not just add them together.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another problem to reinforce your understanding of perimeter. This time, we'll use a square to make it even simpler.\n\n**Question:** A square garden has a side length of 5 meters.

The problem uses a square, which has equal sides, making it simpler to calculate the perimeter.\n2.  The side length is a whole number (5 meters), eliminating the need for decimals.\n3.  This question allows you to apply the perimeter formula (P = 4s) directly to the given side length, reinforcing your understanding of the concept.\n\nTake your time, and remember to multiply the side length by 4 to find the perimeter.
