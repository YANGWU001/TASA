The student is expected to recall the concept of multiplying the numerators and denominators separately. This question assesses their understanding of the basic concept and helps them regain confidence.\n\n**Expected learning outcome:**\n\nIf the student answers this question correctly, it will help them rebuild their understanding of fraction-multiplication and boost their confidence. If they struggle, it will allow us to identify the specific areas of difficulty and create targeted practice questions to address those gaps.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nIf the student answers incorrectly, we can:\n\n1. Break down the concept further and review the basics of fraction-multiplication.\n2. Provide additional practice questions that build upon the concept, gradually increasing the complexity.\n3. Use visual aids, such as diagrams or real-world examples, to help solidify their understanding.\n\nLet's get started with this question and see how the student performs!",

However, they then tried to simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2, which is a good start, but not entirely correct. Dividing 6 by 2 gives 3, and dividing 32 by 2 gives 16, so the fraction 6/32 simplifies to 3/16. The student then gets confused and chooses answer choice B) 1/4, which is incorrect. The correct answer is actually C) 3/16, as it's the simplified product of 2/4 and 3/8.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's progress and recent attempt, the next question will focus on reinforcing their understanding of multiplying fractions with different denominators and simplifying fractions. Here's the next question:\n\n**Question:**\n\nWhat is the product of 3/6 and 2/9?\n\nA) 1/18\nB) 3/18\nC) 2/9\nD) 6/18\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThis question is designed to challenge the student to apply their understanding of fraction-multiplication and simplification to a scenario with different denominators (6 and 9). This will help them practice multiplying fractions with various denominators and reinforce their understanding of equivalent fractions. By choosing the correct answer, the student will demonstrate their ability to multiply fractions, simplify the result, and identify equivalent fractions.\n\n**Expected learning outcome:**\n\nIf the student answers this question correctly, it will help them solidify their understanding of multiplying fractions with different denominators, simplifying fractions, and identifying equivalent fractions. If they struggle, it will allow us to identify specific areas of difficulty and create targeted practice questions to address those gaps.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nIf the student answers incorrectly, we can:\n\n1. Review the concept of equivalent fractions and how to simplify them.\n2. Emphasize the importance of correctly multiplying the numerators and denominators.\n3. Provide additional practice questions that focus on multiplying fractions with different denominators.\n\nLet's see how the student performs with this question!",
