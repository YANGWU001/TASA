When multiplying a fraction by a whole number, we multiply the numerator (the top number) by that whole number. In this case, 5/6 \u00d7 2 would be calculated as 5 \u00d7 2 = 10 in the numerator, and the denominator remains the same, which is 6. However, since the denominator is 6, we need to multiply it by 2 as well to keep the fraction equivalent, resulting in 12. Therefore, the correct answer is indeed 10/12.\n\n**Well done!** You're consistently showing improvement in your understanding of fraction-multiplication. Keep it up!\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo further reinforce your understanding of fraction-multiplication and build your confidence, let's try a question with a slight variation. Here's your next question:\n\n**Question 8:**\n\nWhat is 3/4 \u00d7 5?\n\n**Options:**\n\nA) 15/16\nB) 15/20\nC) 12/20\nD) 15/20\n\nThis question assesses your understanding of multiplying a fraction by a whole number and helps you apply this concept to a slightly different scenario, while also increasing the difficulty slightly by introducing a larger numerator and denominator. Take your time, and remember to multiply the numerator and denominator by the whole number.\n\nNote: The question has been tailored to the student's current knowledge state, gradually increasing the difficulty and introducing more complex scenarios to help them build confidence and mastery.",
