A game that usually costs $60 is now on sale for 15% off. How much will Sarah pay for the game?\n\n**A)** $48\n**B)** $51.50\n**C)** $55\n**D)** $60\n\nThis question reviews the concept of discount by applying a percentage reduction to the original price.

This is a good start, as the discount calculation is correct: $60 \u00d7 0.15 = $9. However, the student incorrectly applied the discount amount to the original price, resulting in a price decrease of $9, making the new price $51, not $48. This mistake is understandable, as it shows a good understanding of the discount concept but a slight misapplication of the calculation.\n\n**Correct Answer:** The correct answer is indeed **B) $51.50**, as the discount amount ($9) is subtracted from the original price ($60), resulting in a new price of $51.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's performance and the need for continued practice, the next question will build on the concept of discounts, introducing a slight increase in complexity while maintaining a moderate level of difficulty. Here's the next question:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA shirt is originally priced at $80.

They correctly calculated the 20% student discount as $16 and subtracted it from the original price, resulting in $64.

Since the student spent exactly $75, the discount should be 0, and the correct answer is indeed the original price.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo reinforce the student's understanding of discounts and help them practice applying a single discount to a total price, the next question will introduce a similar scenario with a slight increase in complexity. Here's the next question:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA clothing store offers a 15% discount for customers who spend more than $80. If a customer buys a shirt priced at $30 and a pair of pants priced at $50, how much will they pay after applying the discount to the total price?\n\n**A)** $72\n**B)** $73\n**C)** $75\n**D)** $78\n\nThis question requires the student to apply a single discount to a total price, which will help reinforce their understanding of how discounts work and how to calculate the total price before applying the discount.\n\nNote: The next question is designed to help the student understand that the discount is applied to the total price after the customer has spent more than the required amount, and that the correct answer is the original price since the customer didn't spend more than $80.",
