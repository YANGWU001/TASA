      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nDon't worry, it's okay to feel unsure about this question. You were on the right track by recognizing that the sum of the interior angles of each triangle is 180\u00b0, but you might have gotten a bit stuck on how to apply that concept to the problem.\n\nLet's break it down together: we know that the sum of the interior angles of each triangle is 180\u00b0, and one angle in each triangle measures 80\u00b0. To find the sum of the measures of the two unknown angles in both triangles, we need to find the sum of the measures of those two angles in one triangle and then multiply it by 2.\n\nSince the sum of the interior angles of one triangle is 180\u00b0 and one angle measures 80\u00b0, the sum of the measures of the two unknown angles in that triangle is 180\u00b0 - 80\u00b0 = 100\u00b0. Since we have two triangles, the sum of the measures of the two unknown angles in both triangles is 100\u00b0 x 2 = 200\u00b0.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices match this calculation. Let's take a closer look at the options: A) 100\u00b0 is close, but it's not the correct answer since we need the sum of the measures of the two unknown angles in both triangles. B) 120\u00b0 and C) 140\u00b0 are also not correct, as they don't take into account the fact that we have two triangles. D) 160\u00b0 is the closest answer choice, but it's still not correct.\n\nLet's try to find a more accurate answer. If we go back to the calculation 100\u00b0 x 2 = 200\u00b0, we realize that we actually need to consider the sum of the measures of the two unknown angles in one triangle, which is 100\u00b0. Since we have two triangles, the sum of the measures of the two unknown angles in both triangles is indeed 100\u00b0 x 2 = 200\u00b0.\n\nHowever, this answer is not among the options. The closest answer choice would be **A) 100\u00b0**, but that's the measure of the sum of the two unknown angles in one triangle, not both triangles. Since we have two triangles, the correct answer should be **200\u00b0**, but it's not among the options. Let's focus on what we can learn from this question and move forward.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nTo help you solidify your understanding of the sum of interior angles of a triangle, let's try a related question that will help you apply this concept in a more practical way.\n\n**Question:** What if you have a triangle with two angles measuring 40\u00b0 and 60\u00b0? If the third angle is x, what is the value of x?\n\nA) 30\u00b0\nB) 40\u00b0\nC) 50\u00b0\nD) 80\u00b0\n\n**Think about it:** You can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180\u00b0 to find the value of x.

When you have a triangle with two angles measuring 30\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, you can simply subtract the sum of these two angles from 180\u00b0 to find the measure of the third angle.\n\nYour initial calculation, 30\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 120\u00b0, is correct, but then you correctly subtracted 120\u00b0 from 180\u00b0 to get 60\u00b0. This is the right approach, but you overcomplicated things by considering another method.\n\nThe correct and simplest way to solve this problem is to directly subtract the sum of the two given angles from 180\u00b0: 180\u00b0 - (30\u00b0 + 90\u00b0) = 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0.
