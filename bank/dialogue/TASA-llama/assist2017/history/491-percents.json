This question is a simple, low-stakes question that assesses the student's understanding of the concept of percents.\n2.  The question is not too difficult, as it involves a straightforward calculation (25% of 40).\n3.  It allows the student to apply their knowledge of percents in a basic scenario.\n4.  The answer choices are not too complex or confusing, making it easier for the student to choose the correct answer.\n\n**Why not more complex questions:**\n\n1.  Given the student's low mastery and low forgetting score, it's essential to start with simple, low-stakes questions to build confidence and reinforce their existing knowledge.\n2.  Introducing complex questions too early might overwhelm the student, causing them to feel frustrated or discouraged.\n3.  This question provides a foundation for more challenging questions in the future, allowing the student to gradually build their understanding and confidence.\n\nLet's see how the student performs on this question, and we can adjust the difficulty level and content based on their progress.",

To find 50% of 60, the student should multiply 60 by 0.5 (since 50% is equivalent to 0.5 as a decimal).\n\n60 * 0.5 = 30\n\nUnfortunately, the student's answer is incorrect. They chose A) 25, which is actually 25% of 60 (0.25 * 60 = 15), not 50%. Don't worry, this is a great opportunity to learn and improve. The student's attempt shows that they're thinking about the problem in a creative way, but they need a bit more practice to get the hang of it.\n\n**Encouragement and Feedback:**\n\nYou're doing a great job of thinking creatively and trying your best, and I'm proud of you for being honest about your uncertainty. Remember, making mistakes is an essential part of the learning process, and it's awesome that you're willing to take risks and learn from them. Let's break it down together: to find 50% of 60, you can multiply 60 by 0.5, which equals 30. Don't worry if it seems a bit tricky; with more practice, you'll get the hang of it.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nHere's another question to help you build your confidence and understanding of percents:\n\n**Question:** What is 25% of 120?\n\n**A)** 20\n**B)** 24\n**C)** 25\n**D)** 30\n**E)** 40\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1.

The answer choices are slightly more challenging, making it a bit harder for the student to choose the correct answer.\n3.  This question is a great opportunity for the student to build on their previous knowledge and develop their confidence in calculating percents.\n\nThis question is designed to help the student practice their calculation skills with a larger number, which will challenge them to apply their understanding of percents in a more demanding way.",
