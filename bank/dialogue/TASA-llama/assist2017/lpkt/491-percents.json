Your thought process is correct that 4 out of 12 is approximately one-fourth, but this actually represents a 25% increase, not 20%.

However, since we're building upon the student's understanding of basic percents, let's simplify this concept by looking at it from a different angle. If we consider the additional stickers (4) as a percentage of the original collection (12), we can see that it's approximately 33.33%, which is close to the option C) 25%.

Your initial thought process is correct that the total number of stickers Tom has now is 24.

But to find the percent increase in the total collection, you need to consider the new total (24) and the original amount (18), then subtract 100% to get the increase. Your calculation of 24/18 \u00d7 100% \u2248 1.33 \u00d7 100% = 133% is close, but it represents the new total as a percentage of the original, not the percent increase.\n\nYour correction of subtracting 100% from 133% to find the increase is almost correct, but it would be 133% - 100% = 33%. However, the correct approach is to find the percent increase of the additional stickers (6) compared to the original amount (18), which you initially found to be approximately 0.33 or 33.33%. \n\nSo, the correct answer is not among the options provided, but your work shows a great understanding of the concept.

If I do 12 \u00f7 180 I get something like 0.06\u2026 maybe that\u2019s 6%? But\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I have to multiply by 100 or something. \n\nActually, I think you might have to add the 12 to 180 first and then divide by the original number. So 180\u202f+\u202f12\u202f=\u202f192, and then 192 \u00f7 180 is about 1.07. That would be like 107%, and if you subtract the original 100% you get 7%, right? \n\nHmm, I\u2019m mixing things up. Maybe the percent increase is just the part you added, which is 12 out of 180. That seems close to 5% if I round weirdly.

Your initial approach to find the percent increase by dividing the extra toys (12) by the original amount (180) is correct, and you arrived at 0.0667, which is approximately 6.67%. However, you got a bit mixed up when trying to find the percent increase.\n\nYou correctly calculated 192 \u00f7 180 \u2248 1.07, which represents the new total as a percentage of the original, but then you thought you should subtract the original 100% to get the increase. Instead, you should have realized that the 1.07 represents a 107% increase, which means the store now has 107% of the original amount. To find the percent increase, you should find the difference between the new total (107%) and the original amount (100%), which would be 107% - 100% = 7%.\n\nYour last approach, thinking the percent increase is just the part you added (12 out of 180), is close but not quite correct. You're on the right track by thinking about the proportion, but you need to remember that percent increase is a comparison of the new amount to the original, not just the difference between the two.\n\nDon't worry, it's all part of the learning process!

You correctly calculated the number of cupcakes after the sale (162) and then added the new shipment (36), resulting in a total of 198 cupcakes.

To do this, you should have divided the increase (18 cupcakes, not 36, since you need to find the increase from 180 to 198) by the original amount (180) and then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.
