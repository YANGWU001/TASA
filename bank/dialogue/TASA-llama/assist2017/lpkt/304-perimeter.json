What is the perimeter of the garden?\n\n**Expected Learning Outcomes:**\n\n1. The student will recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (P = 2l + 2w).\n2. The student will apply the formula to calculate the perimeter of a given rectangle.\n3. The student will demonstrate an understanding of the concept of perimeter by providing a numerical answer.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n* The question requires the student to recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is a fundamental concept they should have learned previously.\n* The numbers used in the question are relatively simple and easy to work with, making it accessible for a student with a low mastery level of 33%.\n* The question is not too complex, allowing the student to build their confidence and understanding of the concept before moving on to more challenging problems.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo solve the problem, the student should multiply the length and width of the garden by 2 and then add the results together:\n\nP = 2l + 2w\nP = 2(8) + 2(5)\nP = 16 + 10\nP = 26 meters\n\nThe correct answer is 26 meters.",

They correctly recalled the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (P = 2l + 2w) and attempted to apply it to the given problem. However, they made a mistake when adding the results of the multiplication. They correctly calculated 2 \u00d7 8 = 16 and 2 \u00d7 5 = 10, but then added 16 + 10 = 26, which is correct. However, they incorrectly added the length and width one more time, resulting in 26 + 8 + 5 = 39.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides. To find the perimeter, we multiply the length by 2 and the width by 2, and then add the results together. In this case, the length is 8 meters and the width is 5 meters. So, we multiply 8 by 2 to get 16, and 5 by 2 to get 10. Then, we add 16 and 10 together to get 26 meters.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build your understanding of perimeter. Here it is:\n\nA rectangular swimming pool measures 12 meters in length and 4 meters in width. What is the perimeter of the pool?\n\nThis question is similar to the previous one, but with slightly larger numbers. It will help you practice applying the formula and build your confidence in your calculations.",

They correctly recalled the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle (P = 2l + 2w) and attempted to apply it to the given problem. They correctly calculated 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 and 2 \u00d7 1.5 = 3, and then added 8 + 3 = 11, which is correct. However, they then showed some confusion about whether to add the length again, which led them to consider adding 4 to 11. This indicates that they are still struggling to apply the formula correctly and trust their initial calculation.\n\nTo find the perimeter, we only need to multiply the length by 2 and the width by 2, and then add the results together. In this case, the correct perimeter of the room is indeed not 15 meters, but we need to calculate it correctly.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build your understanding of perimeter. Here it is:\n\nA rectangular garden measures 6 meters in length and 2 meters in width. What is the perimeter of the garden?\n\nThis question is similar to the previous ones, but with slightly larger numbers. It will help you practice applying the formula and build your confidence in your calculations. Try to break it down step by step and use the formula P = 2l + 2w to find the perimeter.\n\nNote: I've chosen a question with slightly larger numbers to help the student build their fluency in applying the formula and to reduce the likelihood of making errors due to calculation difficulties.",
