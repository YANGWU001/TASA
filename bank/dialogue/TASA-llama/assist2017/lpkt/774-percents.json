Here's a question to help assess and build their understanding of percents:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA shirt is on sale for 25% off its original price of $40. How much will you pay for the shirt after the discount?\n\n**A)** $28\n**B)** $30\n**C)** $32\n**D)** $36\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1.  Assess their understanding of percents: The student needs to apply their knowledge of percents to calculate the discount and find the final price.\n2.  Gradually increase difficulty: The question requires a basic calculation, which is within their current grasp, but still challenging enough to test their understanding.\n3.  Focus on a common real-world application: Discounts and sales are relatable scenarios that can help make the concept more engaging and meaningful.\n\nEncourage the student to think carefully about the problem and show their work to arrive at the correct answer.",

Your calculation was close, but not quite accurate. The correct approach is to find 25% of $40, which is $10, and then subtract this amount from the original price: $40 - $10 = $30. However, you then added the discount amount to the original price instead of subtracting it, which led you to choose $30 as the final price. This is actually the original price minus the discount, not the discounted price. The correct answer is the original price minus the discount, which is $40 - $10 = $30. However, since the shirt is on sale, the price should be lower than the original price. So, the correct answer is the original price minus the discount, which is $40 - $10 = $30. But since the shirt is on sale, the correct answer is actually the original price minus the discount, which is $40 - $10 = $30, and then subtract another $10 because that is the actual discount, so $30 - $10 = $20.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nConsidering you've shown a good understanding of the concept but need a bit more practice with applying it to real-world scenarios, let's try another question that's slightly more challenging but still within your grasp.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA book is on sale for 15% off its original price of $25.

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in applying the 10% off coupon. You correctly calculated that the price of one pair of shoes after the 15% discount is $68. Since you're buying two pairs, the total price after the first discount is $136. To apply the 10% off coupon, you need to calculate 10% of the total price after the first discount, which is 10% of $136.\n\nTo calculate 10% of $136, you can multiply $136 by 0.10:\n\n$136 x 0.10 = $13.60\n\nHowever, you didn't subtract this amount from the total price after the first discount, $136. Instead, you need to subtract $13.60 from $136 to find the final price:\n\n$136 - $13.60 = $122.40\n\nSo, the correct final answer is $122.40.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nConsidering you've shown a good understanding of applying multiple discounts and breaking down problems into manageable parts, let's try another question that builds on this concept. This time, let's introduce a slight twist to challenge your application of percents.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA store is having a sale where everything is 20% off. A pair of shoes originally costs $100. If you buy two pairs of shoes and you have a 5% off coupon that can be used on the total price of both pairs, how much will you pay for both pairs after all discounts?\n\n**A)** $152\n**B)** $160\n**C)** $168\n**D)** $176\n\nTake your time, and show your work to arrive at the correct answer. Remember to apply the 20% discount to the original price of the two pairs of shoes first, and then apply the 5% off coupon to the total price after the first discount.\n\nNote: To help you tackle this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the price of two pairs of shoes after the 20% discount.\n2. Calculate the total price of the two pairs of shoes after the first discount.\n3.

You correctly calculated the price of two pairs of shoes after the 20% discount, which is $160. However, when applying the 5% off coupon, you're unsure about whether to take 5% of the original price or the discounted price. \n\nAlthough the coupon says \"5% off the total price,\" it's indeed referring to the original total price, which is $200. To calculate the 5% off, you correctly found that 5% of $200 is $10. \n\nHowever, the misunderstanding lies in the fact that you didn't subtract this amount from the original price ($200) but rather mentioned taking 5% of $200. Since the 20% discount was already applied to the original price, you should have taken 5% of the original price after the discount. The correct calculation is:\n\n$200 - $10 = $190\n\nSince you already have the price after the 20% discount as $160, the correct final answer is $160.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nConsidering you've shown a good understanding of applying multiple discounts and breaking down problems into manageable parts, let's try another question that builds on this concept.
