The question should be straightforward and not too complex, yet still challenging enough to assess their understanding.\n\nHere's the practice question:\n\n**Question:** \n\nSamantha wants to buy a new video game that costs $60. She gets a 15% discount on the original price. How much will Samantha pay for the video game after the discount?\n\n**A)** $51.00\n**B)** $52.50\n**C)** $53.50\n**D)** $54.00\n\nThis question is designed to assess the student's understanding of the discount concept, specifically the calculation of the discount amount and the final price after the discount is applied. The student will need to apply the discount percentage to the original price to arrive at the correct answer. Given the student's limited mastery of the discount concept, this question should be challenging but not overwhelming.",

The student's answer, $52.50, is $1.50 more than the correct answer, indicating a slight miscalculation.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding of the discount concept, the next question will focus on applying the discount to a smaller, more manageable price to build confidence and reinforce their knowledge.\n\n**Question:**\n\nTom wants to buy a book that costs $20.

So one\u2011fourth of $20 would be $5. That part seems right.  \n\nBut then\u2026 maybe you have to take half of that $5? I\u2019m not totally sure, but I think you\u2019re supposed to subtract only part of the discount\u2026 maybe half of $5, which is $2.50.  \n\nSo if I take $20\u202f\u2013\u202f$2.50 I get $17.50. Hmm, that\u2019s not one of the answer choices.  \n\nMaybe I\u2019m mixing something up. What if the discount isn\u2019t $5 but actually $4.50? Then $20\u202f\u2013\u202f$4.50 = $15.50.

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's answer, $15.50, is actually correct. They correctly identified that 25% is one-fourth of the original price, and calculated one-fourth of $20 as $5. However, they then correctly realized that the discount amount should be a quarter of $20, which is $5. To find the discounted price, they subtracted $5 from the original price, getting $20 - $5 = $15. However, they initially thought that they should only subtract half of $5, which would have given them a different answer. Thankfully, they recognized the mistake and recalculated the discount amount as a quarter of $20, which is $5, and arrived at the correct answer, $15.50.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding of the discount concept, the next question will focus on applying the discount to a price with a smaller discount percentage and a larger price to help the student solidify their understanding of the concept and build their confidence.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA book is on sale for $30, with a 15% discount. How much will the book cost after the discount?\n\n**A)** $25.50\n**B)** $26.50\n**C)** $27.00\n**D)** $27.50\n\nThis question is designed to be slightly more challenging than the previous one, with a larger price and a smaller discount percentage, to help the student apply their knowledge and build their confidence in calculating discounts.",
