Here's a question tailored to their level:\n\n**Question:** \n\nWhat is the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 6 cm and a width of 4 cm?\n\n**A)** 10 cm\n**B)** 12 cm\n**C)** 14 cm\n**D)** 16 cm\n\n**Correct Answer:** \n\nTo solve this question, the student needs to recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. By substituting the given values (l = 6 cm and w = 4 cm), the student should calculate P = 2(6) + 2(4) = 12 + 8 = 20 cm. However, this answer is not among the options, so the student will have to understand the concept that the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all sides and estimate or use the formula to arrive at the correct answer, which is 20 cm.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1.  It assesses the student's understanding of the perimeter formula and its application to a basic geometric shape.\n2.  The question is straightforward, allowing the student to focus on the concept rather than complicated details.\n3.  The options provided are close enough to the correct answer to encourage estimation and critical thinking, but not so close that they would be easily guessed without understanding the concept.\n\nThis question will help the student build their confidence and understanding of the perimeter concept, which is essential for future math problems.",
