Here's a question to help the student regain their footing:\n\n**Question:** 1/2 \u00d7 3 = ?\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1.  This question focuses on a basic fraction multiplication problem, which is a fundamental concept the student is struggling with.\n2.  The numerator (1) is a simple, single-digit number, and the denominator (2) is a small, familiar number.\n3.  The multiplier (3) is also a single-digit number, making the problem relatively straightforward.\n4.  This question allows the student to practice multiplying a fraction by a whole number, a fundamental operation they need to master.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\n*   If the student is still struggling, they might respond with a completely incorrect answer or a partially correct but incorrect answer (e.g., 4 or 5).\n*   If the student is starting to regain their understanding, they might respond with an incorrect answer that's close to the correct answer (e.g., 3 or 4).\n*   If the student is on the right track, they might respond with the correct answer (3/2 or 1.5).\n\n**Assessment and Feedback:**\n\n*   After the student responds, I'll provide feedback in the form of a gentle correction or a hint to help them understand the mistake.\n*   I'll also offer a clear explanation of the correct solution, highlighting the key concepts and steps involved in the problem.\n*   Depending on the student's response, I might provide additional practice questions that gradually increase in difficulty to help them build their confidence and skills.\n\nBy starting with this question, we can begin to rebuild the student's foundation in fraction-multiplication and work towards regaining their mastery of the concept.",

You correctly multiplied the numerator (3) by the whole number (2) to get 6, but then you changed the denominator from 4 to 8, which is incorrect. When multiplying a fraction by a whole number, we keep the denominator the same. In this case, the denominator should remain 4.\n\nHowever, you're on the right track by multiplying the numerator correctly. Let's break it down:\n\n3/4 \u00d7 2 = (3 \u00d7 2) / 4 = 6/4\n\nWe can simplify 6/4 to 1.5, but the fraction 6/4 is also a correct representation of the answer.\n\nTo help you build upon this understanding, let's try a question that involves a slightly more complex fraction with a larger denominator. Here's your next challenge:\n\n**Question:** 1/6 \u00d7 3 = ?\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1.  This question involves multiplying a fraction by a whole number with a less familiar denominator (6).\n2.  The numerator (1) is a simple, single-digit number.\n3.  The multiplier (3) is a small, manageable number.\n4.  This question allows you to practice multiplying a fraction by a whole number with a small numerator and a larger denominator.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\n*   If you're still struggling, you might respond with a completely incorrect answer or a partially correct but incorrect answer.\n*   If you're starting to regain your understanding, you might respond with an incorrect answer that's close to the correct answer.\n*   If you're on the right track, you might respond with the correct answer (3/6 or 0.5).\n\n**Assessment and Feedback:**\n\n*   After you respond, I'll provide feedback in the form of a gentle correction or a hint to help you understand the mistake.\n*   I'll also offer a clear explanation of the correct solution, highlighting the key concepts and steps involved in the problem.\n*   Depending on your response, I might provide additional practice questions that gradually increase in difficulty to help you build your confidence and skills.",
