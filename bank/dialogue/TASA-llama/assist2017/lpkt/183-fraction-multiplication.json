      "content": "Given the student's struggle with fraction-multiplication and their high forgetting score, it's essential to create a question that is not too difficult but still assesses their understanding. Here's a question tailored to their current knowledge level:\n\n**Question:** \n\n2/3 \u00d7 1/4 = ?\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n1.  The question involves a basic multiplication of fractions, which should be within the student's grasp given their current mastery level.\n2.  The fractions 2/3 and 1/4 are not too complex, making it easier for the student to focus on the multiplication process.\n3.  The answer can be calculated using basic fraction-multiplication rules, which will help the student assess their understanding of the concept.\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n\n1.  Review the student's understanding of fraction-multiplication rules.\n2.  Assess their ability to apply these rules to simple fraction-multiplication problems.\n3.  Identify areas where the student may need additional practice or review to improve their understanding.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nTo calculate 2/3 \u00d7 1/4, the student can multiply the numerators (2 \u00d7 1 = 2) and the denominators (3 \u00d7 4 = 12), resulting in the product 2/12. This can be simplified to 1/6.\n\n**Additional feedback:**\n\n*   If the student answers incorrectly, provide guidance on the multiplication process, focusing on the numerators and denominators.\n*   If the student answers correctly, encourage them to simplify the product and provide additional examples to build their confidence.",
