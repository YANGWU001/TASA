How many blue notebooks does Tom have?\"\n\nThis question requires the student to apply the concept of finding percents to a real-world scenario, using a concrete number (15) and a specific percentage (30%). The student's task is to calculate 30% of 15, which should help build their understanding and accuracy with percent calculations.\n\nTo make it even more engaging, I'll provide two answer choices for the student to choose from:\n\nA) 4.5\nB) 5\nC) 3\nD) 2.5\n\nThis question will allow the student to demonstrate their understanding of finding percents, and I can assess their performance and provide feedback accordingly.",
