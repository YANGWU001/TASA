Multiplying a fraction by a whole number involves multiplying the numerator of the fraction by that whole number. In this case, 1/2 multiplied by 3 is calculated as 1 \u00d7 3 = 3 (for the numerator) and the denominator remains the same, 2. So, the correct result of multiplying 1/2 by 3 is actually 3/2. This question is a fundamental concept in fraction-multiplication, and it seems we need to revisit this topic to reinforce your understanding.\n\n**Next Question:**\nTo build on this concept, let's try a similar question with a slight variation. Here's the next one:\n\nQuestion 2: Multiple Choice\n\nWhat is the result of multiplying 2/3 by 2?\n\nA) 4/3\nB) 5/3\nC) 4\nD) 6\n\nThis question introduces a slightly more complex scenario, multiplying a fraction by a whole number, similar to the previous question, but with a different numerator and denominator. It will help the tutor gauge your understanding of the multiplication process and provide a foundation for further practice.\n\nPlease take your time, and let's see how you approach this question.",

You correctly multiplied the numerators (6 and 2) to get 12 and the denominators (7 and 3) to get 21. This resulted in the fraction 12/21. However, the next step is not to simplify the fraction by dividing both numbers by 2. Instead, the correct approach is to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together, and then simplify the resulting fraction if necessary. You were correct that your initial result, 12/21, is actually the correct answer. This is because the fraction 12/21 cannot be simplified further, so your initial intuition was correct.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo reinforce your understanding of multiplying fractions and to build on your recent success, let's try a question that involves multiplying a fraction by a fraction with a common factor.
