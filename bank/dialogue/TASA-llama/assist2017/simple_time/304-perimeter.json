What is the perimeter of the garden?\n\n**A)** 18 meters\n**B)** 20 meters\n**C)** 22 meters\n**D)** 26 meters\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n- The student has shown a low mastery level of 33%, so I've kept the scenario simple and familiar to their current understanding.\n- The question involves a basic rectangle with a length and width, which aligns with the student's retained knowledge.\n- The numbers are manageable, allowing the student to recall the formula for perimeter (P = 2l + 2w) without feeling overwhelmed.\n- The answer choices are clear and concise, making it easier for the student to choose the correct response.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\n\nThis question aims to assess the student's ability to apply the perimeter formula (P = 2l + 2w) to a simple scenario. It will help me gauge their understanding of the concept and provide a solid foundation for further practice and review.",

The student attempted to use the formula for perimeter (P = 2l + 2w) but made a calculation error.

A correct calculation would be to multiply the length by 2 (8 \u00d7 2 = 16) and the width by 2 (5 \u00d7 2 = 10), then add those two values together (16 + 10 = 26).\n\n**Encouragement and Feedback:**\n\nDon't worry, it's okay to make mistakes \u2013 they're an essential part of the learning process.

The student attempted to use the formula for perimeter (P = 2l + 2w) and correctly identified the length (12 meters) and width (9 meters) of the swimming pool. They also correctly multiplied the length by 2 (12 \u00d7 2 = 24) and the width by 2 (9 \u00d7 2 = 18). However, they didn't add the two results together correctly. To find the perimeter, they should have added the two results: 24 + 18 = 42. The correct answer is indeed not among the options, but the correct calculation is 42 meters.\n\n**Encouragement and Feedback:**\n\nYou're getting closer, and it's great that you're thinking through the calculation step by step. Remember, the formula is P = 2l + 2w, so we multiply the length and width by 2 separately and then add those two values together.
