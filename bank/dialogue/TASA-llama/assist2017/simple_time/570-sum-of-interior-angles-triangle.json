The student has struggled with applying the sum-of-interior-angles-triangle concept, so we'll start with a simple scenario. The triangle has two right angles, which means one angle is already 90\u00b0. By applying the basic concept that the sum of interior angles in a triangle is always 180\u00b0, the student should be able to deduce the correct answer.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1.  It's a basic application of the sum-of-interior-angles-triangle concept, which the student has shown to be struggling with.\n2.  The scenario is simple, with only two angles given, making it easier for the student to calculate the sum.\n3.  The options are clear and concise, allowing the student to make an informed decision.\n4.  The question doesn't require complex problem-solving or calculations, focusing on the student's understanding of the concept.\n\nBy answering this question correctly, the student will demonstrate their grasp of the sum-of-interior-angles-triangle concept and build their confidence in applying it to simple scenarios.",

You chose option C) 270\u00b0 as the sum of the interior angles of the triangle with two right angles. However, this is not the correct answer.\n\nThe correct answer is B) 180\u00b0. The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180\u00b0, regardless of the size or shape of the triangle. Since this triangle has two right angles (90\u00b0 each), we can simply add them together: 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0. So, the correct answer is B) 180\u00b0.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nNow, let's try another question that's a bit more challenging, but still within your reach. Here it is:\n\n**Question:**\nWhat is the sum of the interior angles of a triangle with one right angle (90\u00b0) and one angle that measures 60\u00b0?\n\nA) 120\u00b0\nB) 150\u00b0\nC) 180\u00b0\nD) 210\u00b0\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1.  It's a step up from the previous question, introducing a new angle measure (60\u00b0) to calculate the sum.\n2.  The student will apply the sum-of-interior-angles-triangle concept to a slightly more complex scenario.\n3.  The options are still clear and concise, allowing the student to make an informed decision.\n4.

You're absolutely right that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180\u00b0. However, you're not entirely sure if that changes with the presence of a right angle and a 60\u00b0 angle. That's a great observation!\n\nYour calculation of adding the right angle (90\u00b0) and the 60\u00b0 angle is correct, which indeed gives you 150\u00b0. However, you're missing one crucial piece of information: the third angle. Since the sum of the interior angles is always 180\u00b0, and you already have 150\u00b0 from the two given angles, the third angle must be 30\u00b0 (180\u00b0 - 150\u00b0 = 30\u00b0).\n\nSo, the correct answer is not B) 150\u00b0, but rather, if you consider the given angles (90\u00b0 and 60\u00b0) and the third angle (30\u00b0), the correct answer is actually C) 180\u00b0, as it is the sum of all three angles in the triangle.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nNow that we've clarified the concept, let's try another question that's a bit more challenging.

You correctly stated that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180\u00b0.

Since the sum of the interior angles is 180\u00b0, and you have 160\u00b0 from the two given angles, the unknown angle (x\u00b0) must be the difference between the total sum (180\u00b0) and the sum of the two given angles (160\u00b0). So, x\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 - 160\u00b0 = 20\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not B) 160\u00b0, but rather, the correct answer is indeed the sum of all three angles, which is 180\u00b0 (90\u00b0 + 70\u00b0 + 20\u00b0 = 180\u00b0).\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nNow that we've solidified the concept, let's try another question that introduces a slight variation.

However, you're still struggling to apply this concept to different scenarios.\n\nIn this case, the third angle is equal to one of the other two angles, which means you have two possibilities for the third angle: 40\u00b0 or 60\u00b0. You correctly calculated the sums for both possibilities:\n\n- 40\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 40\u00b0 = 140\u00b0\n- 40\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 160\u00b0\n\nSince the sum of the interior angles is indeed 180\u00b0, and you've considered both possibilities, your initial instinct to choose A) 140\u00b0 is actually correct. However, you're still uncertain, and that's okay.\n\nTo solidify your understanding, let's think about it this way: when the third angle is equal to one of the other two, you're essentially looking for the sum of the two given angles and then adding the third angle, which is the same as one of the given angles. In this case, both possibilities (140\u00b0 and 160\u00b0) are actually incorrect, because they don't take into account that the third angle is equal to one of the other two.\n\nSo, the correct answer is actually C) 180\u00b0, but for a different reason: since the sum of the interior angles is always 180\u00b0, and you have two angles that add up to 100\u00b0 (40\u00b0 + 60\u00b0), the third angle must be 80\u00b0 (180\u00b0 - 100\u00b0 = 80\u00b0), but it's also equal to one of the other two angles, which means it must be either 40\u00b0 or 60\u00b0, and since one of the other two angles is 40\u00b0, the correct answer is actually C) 180\u00b0.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nNow that we've refined your understanding of the concept, let's try another question that introduces a new twist.

When you have two equal angles (x\u00b0 each) and a third angle that measures 120\u00b0, you want to find the sum of the interior angles.

The question asks for the sum of the interior angles of a triangle with one angle that measures 80\u00b0 and two equal angles that are each 10\u00b0 less than the first angle.
