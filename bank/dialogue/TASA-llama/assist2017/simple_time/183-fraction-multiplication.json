The question will be designed to assess their understanding and build upon their current knowledge.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\n**Question:** 1/2 \u00d7 3/4 = ?\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n* The question involves multiplying two fractions, which is the specific concept the student needs improvement in.\n* The fractions used are relatively simple, with a numerator and denominator of 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, respectively. This will help the student build on their current understanding and avoid overwhelming them with complex fractions.\n* The question requires the student to apply the concept of multiplying the numerators and denominators separately, which is a fundamental aspect of fraction multiplication.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\n\n* If the student is able to answer this question correctly, it will indicate that they have a good understanding of the concept of fraction multiplication and are ready to move on to more complex questions.\n* If the student struggles with this question, it will help identify specific areas where they need additional practice and review.\n\nLet's see how the student performs on this question!",

Unfortunately, this is incorrect.\n\n**Explanation:**\nTo multiply fractions, we need to multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) and the denominators (the numbers on the bottom) separately. In this case, the numerator of the first fraction is 1, and the numerator of the second fraction is 3. So, we multiply 1 \u00d7 3 = 3. The denominator of the first fraction is 2, and the denominator of the second fraction is 4. So, we multiply 2 \u00d7 4 = 8. Therefore, the correct answer is 3/8.\n\n**Next Question:**\nDon't worry, it's okay to make mistakes \u2013 they're an essential part of the learning process!

However, the student also correctly identified that the answer simplifies to 1/5, which is partially correct. To fully understand the mistake, let's review the correct process: when multiplying fractions, we multiply the numerators and denominators separately, which gives us 6/25. To simplify this fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 6 and 25. The GCD is 1, so the fraction 6/25 is already in its simplest form, and it's not equal to 1/5.\n\n**Next Question:**\nDon't worry, it's okay to make mistakes \u2013 they're an essential part of the learning process!

You correctly multiplied the numerators (2 \u00d7 3 = 6) and denominators (9 \u00d7 9 = 81), resulting in the fraction 6/81. However, when simplifying the fraction, you attempted to divide both the numerator and denominator by 9, which is a good start. However, the correct simplification is not 2/3. When you divided 6 by 9, you got 0.666..., but since you're working with fractions, you should express the result as a fraction. 6 \u00f7 9 is actually 2/3, but when you divide 81 by 9, you get 9, not 9 as a whole number. You should keep the denominator as 9. So, the correct simplification would be to divide both the numerator and denominator by 3, resulting in 2/27.
