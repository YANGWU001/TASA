Here's a question tailored to their level:\n\n**Question 1:** \"Tom has 5 different colored pens in his pencil case.

The question is straightforward, and the answer can be calculated using the combination formula (C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)), but it's not too complex for a student with a low mastery level. The student can start by listing the possible combinations or using a simple approach, such as using the formula for small numbers.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\n\nThis question helps the student to:\n\n1. Understand the basic concept of combinations.\n2. Apply the combination formula for small numbers.\n3. Develop problem-solving skills for combinatorics.\n\n**Feedback and Guidance:**\n\nAfter the student attempts the question, I would provide feedback and guidance to help them understand the correct solution. This might include:\n\n* Explaining the concept of combinations and how it applies to the problem.\n* Showing the calculation of the combination formula for small numbers.\n* Providing examples of different combinations of pens Tom can choose.\n* Encouraging the student to try different approaches, such as listing the combinations or using the formula.\n\nThis question sets the stage for further practice and exploration of more complex combinatorics concepts, tailored to the student's learning pace and needs.",

      "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's answer, **B) 5**, is incorrect. When Tom chooses 2 pens from 5 different colored pens, we need to consider the different combinations of 2 pens that can be chosen. This can be calculated using the combination formula, C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items (5 pens), and k is the number of items to choose (2 pens).\n\nLet's calculate the combination: C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = (5*4*3*2*1) / ((2*1)*(3*2*1)) = 120 / (2*6) = 10.\n\nThere are 10 different combinations of 2 pens that Tom can choose from 5 pens. Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 10**.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding of combinations and their need for improvement, the next question will build on the concept of combinations by introducing the concept of order. This will help the student develop problem-solving skills and apply the combination formula to more complex scenarios.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\n\"Tom wants to choose 3 books from a shelf that contains 8 books.

The student needs to recognize that the order of the books matters, which means they will need to use the permutation formula (P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!) instead of the combination formula. This will help the student develop their problem-solving skills and understand the difference between combinations and permutations.\n\n**Learning Objective:**\n\nThis question helps the student to:\n\n1.

Although the student correctly identified the need to use the permutation formula, P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!, they made a calculation error in the factorial part. Let's break it down correctly: P(9, 5) = 9! / 4! = (9*8*7*6*5) / (4*3*2*1). The correct calculation is: (9*8*7*6*5) = 15120, but then the student needs to divide by 4!

Although the student correctly identified the need to use the permutation formula, P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!, they made a calculation error in the factorial part. Let's break it down correctly: P(10, 4) = 10! / 6! = (10*9*8*7) / (6*5*4*3*2*1). The correct calculation is: (10*9*8*7) = 5040, but the student is correct in recognizing that they need to divide by 6!. \n\nHowever, the student is correct that they should consider the books in the same genre as indistinguishable. Let's recalculate the problem, treating the three novels as one group, the three biographies as one group, and the two self-help books as one group. \n\nIn this case, the student would calculate the permutations of 4 groups from 4 groups (the 3 novels, the 3 biographies, the 2 self-help books, and the 1 science book + 1 history book), which is P(4, 4) = 4! = 24. However, within each group, the order of the books doesn't matter, so we need to divide by the number of permutations of each group: 3! for the novels, 3! for the biographies, and 2! for the self-help books. \n\nThe correct calculation is: 24 / (3! * 3! * 2!) = 24 / (6 * 6 * 2) = 24 / 72 = 1/3. However, this is not among the answer choices, and the student's original answer was actually correct in a different way. The student correctly calculated 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 = 5040, but forgot to divide by 6!. The correct answer is indeed 5040 / 6! = 5040 / (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 5040 / 720 = 7. \n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding of permutations and their need for improvement in applying the permutation formula, the next question will build on their knowledge by introducing a scenario that requires the use of permutations and more complex calculations.\n\n**Question 8:**\n\n\"A box of chocolates contains 8 different types of chocolates: almonds, pecans, walnuts, hazelnuts, macadamia, caramel, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and peanut butter cups.
