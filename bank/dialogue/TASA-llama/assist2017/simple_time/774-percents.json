Here's the question:\n\n**Question 1: Introduction to Percents**\n\n\"Tom has 15 pencils in his pencil case. He gives 1/5 of them to his friend. What fraction of the pencils does Tom have left?\"\n\nThis question assesses the student's understanding of percents as a fraction and helps them connect the concept to a simple, relatable scenario. By starting with a basic concept, I'm aiming to build the student's confidence and fluency in understanding percents.\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1.  It's an easy-to-understand scenario, making it less overwhelming for the student.\n2.  It introduces the concept of percents as a fraction, which is a fundamental aspect of percent mastery.\n3.  It requires the student to apply their existing knowledge of fractions to solve the problem, making it a gentle progression from their current understanding.\n4.  The question has a clear, numerical answer, making it easy to check for accuracy and provide feedback.",

When Tom gives away 1/5 of his 15 pencils, he gives away 3 pencils (1/5 of 15 is 3). To find out how many pencils he has left, we subtract the pencils he gave away from the total: 15 - 3 = 12. Since 12 is 4/5 of the total pencils (because 15 is the whole and 12 is 4 out of the 5 equal parts), Tom has 4/5 of his pencils left.\n\nDon't worry, it's a common mistake, and it's great that you were thinking about the problem in terms of parts of a whole! Let's build on that understanding with the next question.\n\n**Next Question: Building on the Concept**\n\n\"Sarah has 20 stickers in her sticker collection.
