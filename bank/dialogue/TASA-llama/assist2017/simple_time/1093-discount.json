If she gets a 15% discount, how much will she pay for the sneakers?\n\n**A)** $68\n**B)** $72\n**C)** $76\n**D)** $84\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1.  Introduce the concept of a discount percentage and its application to a real-world scenario.\n2.  Use a moderate discount percentage (15%) to challenge the student without overwhelming them.\n3.  Require the student to calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the original price, which is a fundamental skill for understanding the concept of discount.\n4.  Provide a clear and straightforward question to help the student build confidence and gradually improve their understanding of the discount concept.\n\nThis question assesses the student's ability to apply the discount concept and encourages them to think critically about the relationship between the original price, discount percentage, and the final price paid.",

They approximated the 18% discount by estimating the result of 0.18 multiplied by $60, which is actually $10.80. However, they used this approximation to subtract from the original price of $60, resulting in a final price of $50, which is close but not accurate.
