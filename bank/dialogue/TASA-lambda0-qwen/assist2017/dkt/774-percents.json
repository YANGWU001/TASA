Given the student\u2019s current low mastery (~30%) and struggles with *finding percents*, we want to start with a **clear, simple, and foundational** question that reinforces the core concept without overwhelming them.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Goal of the Question:\n- Build confidence by focusing on **basic percent interpretation** (e.g., \u201cWhat percent of X is Y?\u201d)\n- Avoid multi-step problems or abstract word problems\n- Use familiar, concrete numbers to reduce cognitive load\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**What percent of 50 is 15?**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why this works:\n- It\u2019s a direct \"finding a percent\" question (a key area of difficulty).\n- Numbers are small and manageable (50 and 15 are easy to work with).\n- The answer is a whole number (30%), which helps reinforce the concept and builds confidence.\n- It mirrors real-world situations (e.g., \"What percent of 50 students passed if 15 passed?\").\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Suggested Next Step (for the student):\nAfter solving, ask:  \n\ud83d\udc49 *\"How did you get that answer? Did you divide 15 by 50 and then multiply by 100?\"*  \nThis helps reinforce the **formula**:  \n**Percent = (Part \u00f7 Whole) \u00d7 100**\n\n---\n\nLet me know when they\u2019ve tried it \u2014 I\u2019ll be ready to give feedback or a follow-up question! \ud83d\ude0a",
