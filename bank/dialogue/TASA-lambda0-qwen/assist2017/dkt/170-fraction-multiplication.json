    "content": "Absolutely! Given that the student has **very low retention** (only ~16% accuracy after 5,450 days without practice) and a **high forgetting score of 0.81**, it's clear they need a **simple, foundational, and concrete** start \u2014 one that rebuilds confidence and reinforces the core concept without overwhelming them.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Goal of First Practice Question:\n- Focus on **simple fractions** (denominators \u2264 10).\n- Use **visual or intuitive reasoning** (e.g., \"what part of a part is this?\").\n- Avoid complex numbers or steps.\n- Reinforce the **basic rule**: multiply numerators, multiply denominators.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**What is $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} $?**\n\n> *Hint: Think about what happens when you take half of one-third.

That\u2019s brilliant.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify this once and for all \u2014 with **clarity, logic, and a visual anchor**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 The Correct Rule (Reinforced \u2014 with Confidence)\n\n> \ud83d\udd11 **To multiply two fractions:**  \n> - **Multiply the numerators**  \n> - **Multiply the denominators**  \n> - **Never add the denominators**  \n> - The result will be **smaller than both original fractions**\n\nSo:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{2 \\times 3} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\n\n\u2705 This is **not just a math rule** \u2014 it\u2019s a **logical rule** based on what \"taking a part of a part\" really means.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Why \"Adding Denominators\" Is a Common Mistake (Even After a Long Break)\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Your brain naturally looks for patterns.  \nWhen you see:\n- $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{5}$ \u2192 because $2 + 3 = 5$  \n- $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{9}$ \u2192 because $4 + 5 = 9$\n\n\u2026it *feels* like a pattern.  \nIt\u2019s **easy to remember** and **easy to say**.  \nBut it\u2019s **mathematically wrong**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Think about it:  \nIf you take **half of a half**, you get **one-fourth** \u2014 not one-third.  \n- $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$ \u2014 not $\\frac{1}{3}$  \n- And $2 + 2 = 4$ \u2192 so it *only works* when you **add** the denominators, which is **not a rule of multiplication**\n\nSo the pattern \"add denominators\" is **false**.  \nThe real rule is: **multiply denominators**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 Visual Anchor (To Help You Remember)\n\nImagine a **whole pizza**:\n\n1. Cut it in **2 equal pieces** \u2192 each is $\\frac{1}{2}$\n2. Take **one of those halves**\n3. Now cut *that half* into **3 equal pieces** \u2192 each piece is $\\frac{1}{6}$ of the whole pizza\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So:  \nOne-half of one-third = **one-sixth** of the whole.\n\n> \u2705 This is **exactly** what $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{6}$ means.\n\nNo adding. No guessing. Just **multiplying**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Takeaway for You\n\n| Idea | Is it true? | Why |\n|------|------------|-----|\n| \u2705 Multiply numerators | Yes | $1 \\times 1 = 1$ |\n| \u2705 Multiply denominators | Yes | $2 \\times 3 = 6$ |\n| \u274c Add denominators | No | $2 + 3 = 5$ \u2192 wrong answer |\n| \ud83d\udccc The product is smaller than both fractions | Yes | $\\frac{1}{6} < \\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{6} < \\frac{1}{2}$ |\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 **Mnemonic**:  \n> \"**Multiply the tops, multiply the bottoms**\"  \n> (Like \"MOM\" \u2014 Multiply the Numerators, Multiply the Denominators)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Step: A Simple, Safe Question to Build Confidence\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 **What is $\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4}$?**  \n>  \n> \ud83d\udcdd *Think through it step by step:*\n> - What do the numerators give?  \n> - What do the denominators give?  \n> - Does the answer make sense (i.e., smaller than both",
