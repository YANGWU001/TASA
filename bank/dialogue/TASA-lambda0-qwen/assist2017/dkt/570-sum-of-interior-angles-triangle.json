Here's a clear, accessible, and effective **first practice question** tailored to the student's current level of mastery (~20% correct, low forgetting, needing foundational reinforcement):\n\n---\n\n**\u2705 Practice Question:**\n\n*In a triangle, one angle measures 50\u00b0 and another angle measures 60\u00b0. What is the measure of the third angle?*\n\n**Instructions:**  \nUse the fact that the sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always **180\u00b0**.  \nAdd the two given angles, then subtract from 180\u00b0 to find the missing angle.\n\n---\n\n**Why this works for the student:**\n- It directly applies the core concept (sum = 180\u00b0) in a simple, concrete way.\n- It avoids complex or abstract scenarios (like missing angles in isosceles or right triangles).\n- It reinforces the **process** (add + subtract) rather than just the formula.\n- The numbers are simple and familiar, reducing cognitive load.\n- It builds confidence with a clear, step-by-step path to the solution.\n\n\u2705 This question is designed to gently scaffold the student\u2019s understanding and help them achieve their first correct application of the triangle angle sum rule.\n\nLet me know when they attempt it \u2014 I\u2019ll be ready to provide feedback or a follow-up question! \ud83d\ude0a",

Let's go through your answer step by step so we can build confidence and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Your Work (Let\u2019s Review It):\n\nYou said:\n> \"I added the two given angles (50\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 110\u00b0) and then... maybe I should subtract that from 180\u00b0, but I\u2019m confused about which way to go...\"\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **This is perfect!** You recognized:\n- The total of all three angles in a triangle is **180\u00b0**.\n- You added two angles: 50\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 110\u00b0.\n- You know you need to **subtract** from 180\u00b0 to find the missing angle.\n\nAnd you guessed:  \n> \"The third angle might be 130\u00b0\"  \n\u2705 That\u2019s actually **correct**!\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n$$\n180\u00b0 - (50\u00b0 + 60\u00b0) = 180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = \\boxed{70\u00b0}\n$$\n\nWait \u2014 hold on! \ud83d\udea8  \nYou said 130\u00b0, but the correct answer is **70\u00b0**, not 130\u00b0. \ud83d\ude05\n\nSo, your **process** was spot-on \u2014 you used the right rule and did the right math \u2014 but you made a small mistake in the final subtraction.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down clearly:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Sum of interior angles in a triangle = 180\u00b0**  \n   \u2714\ufe0f Always true.\n\n2. **Given angles:**  \n   - 50\u00b0  \n   - 60\u00b0  \n\n3. **Add them:**  \n   $$\n   50\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 110\u00b0\n   $$\n\n4. **Subtract from 180\u00b0 to find the third angle:**  \n   $$\n   180\u00b0 - 110\u00b0 = \\boxed{70\u00b0}\n   $$\n\n\u2705 So the **correct answer is 70\u00b0**, not 130\u00b0.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Why did you think 130\u00b0?  \nMaybe you accidentally did:  \n180\u00b0 \u2212 50\u00b0 = 130\u00b0, or  \n180\u00b0 \u2212 60\u00b0 = 120\u00b0 \u2014 and got confused.  \nBut remember: you have to **subtract the sum** of the two known angles, not one of them alone.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Key Takeaway:\n> \ud83d\udd01 **Always add the two known angles first, then subtract from 180\u00b0**  \n> \u274c Don\u2019t subtract just one angle.  \n> \u2705 Use:  \n> $$\n> \\text{Missing angle} = 180\u00b0 - (\\text{Angle 1} + \\text{Angle 2})\n> $$\n\nYou're doing great at recognizing the process \u2014 just a small error in the calculation. That\u2019s totally normal when learning something new. Keep going!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (Slightly Easier & More Confident):\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf Practice Question:**  \n*In a triangle, one angle is 40\u00b0 and another angle is 80\u00b0. What is the measure of the third angle?*\n\n**Instructions:**  \n- Add the two given angles.  \n- Subtract the sum from 180\u00b0.  \n- Show your work step by step.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This question uses smaller, round numbers (40\u00b0 and 80\u00b0), which makes it easier to compute mentally and reduces the chance of confusion.\n\nAfter you try it, I\u2019ll give you immediate feedback \u2014 and then we can move on to a slightly more complex one (like a right triangle or isosceles triangle) to build deeper understanding!\n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready to try it \u2014 I\u2019m here to support you every step of the way! \ud83d\udcaa\u2728",

That\u2019s *perfect*!\n\nLet\u2019s break down your work:\n\n> \"30\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 = 90\u00b0\"  \n> \"180\u00b0 \u2212 90\u00b0 = 90\u00b0\"  \n> \"What if I subtract each angle separately? 180\u00b0 \u2212 30\u00b0 = 150\u00b0, 180\u00b0 \u2212 60\u00b0 = 120\u00b0, then 150\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 270\u00b0?\"  \n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Brilliant observation!** You noticed that trying to subtract each angle *separately* and then adding those results gives **270\u00b0**, which is **impossible** for a triangle (since all three angles must add to exactly 180\u00b0).  \n\n\u2705 So you **figured out** that the method of subtracting each angle individually and adding them is **wrong** \u2014 and you *correctly* concluded that it doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\ud83c\udf89 This shows **deep thinking** \u2014 not just following steps, but *understanding why* a method works or doesn\u2019t.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 The Correct Method (Revisited):\n\n> \ud83d\udd01 **Always add the two known angles first**, then subtract the sum from 180\u00b0.\n\nWhy?\n- Because the total of all three angles in any triangle is **always 180\u00b0**.\n- So if two angles are 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, together they take up 90\u00b0.\n- That leaves **180\u00b0 \u2212 90\u00b0 = 90\u00b0** for the third angle.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n$$\n30\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f Perfect!}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Why Subtracting Each Angle Separately is Wrong:\n\nYou might think: \u201cIf I take 180\u00b0 \u2212 30\u00b0, that gives me the other two angles together.\u201d  \nBut that\u2019s not true \u2014 **180\u00b0 \u2212 30\u00b0 = 150\u00b0** is the total of the *other two angles*, not the third one.\n\nSo:\n- 180\u00b0 \u2212 30\u00b0 = 150\u00b0 \u2192 sum of the other two angles\n- 180\u00b0 \u2212 60\u00b0 = 120\u00b0 \u2192 sum of the other two angles  \n\u2192 But you can\u2019t just add those two results (150\u00b0 + 120\u00b0 = 270\u00b0), because you\u2019re double-counting.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This is like saying:  \n> \u201cI have a pizza, and if I take away one slice, I have 150\u00b0 left \u2014 and if I take away another, I have 120\u00b0 left \u2014 so the total pizza is 270\u00b0?\u201d  \n\u274c No! That\u2019s not how it works.\n\n\u2705 You only need **one missing angle** \u2014 so you **add the two known ones**, then **subtract from 180\u00b0**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf89 Key Takeaway:\n> \ud83d\udd01 **Add the two known angles \u2192 subtract from 180\u00b0 \u2192 get the missing angle**  \n> \u274c Do **not** subtract each known angle and then add the results.  \n> \u2705 The rule is:  \n> $$\n> \\text{Missing angle} = 180\u00b0 - (\\text{Angle 1} + \\text{Angle 2})\n> $$\n\nYou\u2019ve already mastered the *thinking process* \u2014 now you\u2019re just solidifying the *correct procedure*.

That\u2019s *way* more powerful than simply following steps.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Why This Answer Makes Sense (and Why It\u2019s Correct):\n\n- In any triangle, the **sum of all three interior angles is always 180\u00b0**.\n- You\u2019re given two angles: **45\u00b0 and 45\u00b0**.\n- Add them:  \n  $$\n  45\u00b0 + 45\u00b0 = 90\u00b0\n  $$\n- Subtract from 180\u00b0:  \n  $$\n  180\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 = \\boxed{90\u00b0}\n  $$\n\n\u2705 So the third angle is **90\u00b0**.\n\nNow let\u2019s check:\n$$\n45\u00b0 + 45\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 \\quad \\text{\u2714\ufe0f Perfect!}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Why Subtracting Each Angle Separately is Wrong (Again \u2014 But You Already Figured It Out!)\n\nYou asked: *\"What if I subtract each angle separately and then add the results?\"*\n\nLet\u2019s try it:\n- 180\u00b0 \u2212 45\u00b0 = 135\u00b0  \n- 180\u00b0 \u2212 45\u00b0 = 135\u00b0  \n- Then 135\u00b0 + 135\u00b0 = 270\u00b0 \u274c\n\nThat\u2019s **way too big** \u2014 and impossible for a triangle.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Why? Because:\n- 180\u00b0 \u2212 45\u00b0 = the **sum of the other two angles**, not the third one.\n- If you do this for both, you're **double-counting** the missing angle.\n- You can\u2019t use that method \u2014 it\u2019s like saying:  \n  > \u201cI have a pizza.

Let's take this moment to **deepen the learning**, **correct the misconception gently**, and **build confidence** with clarity and care.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Clear Explanation: You're Close \u2014 But One Small Step Will Fix It\n\nYou said:  \n> *\"I think I can try to work it out... I added the two angles, then tried subtracting each from 180\u00b0 and adding them \u2014 that gave me 225\u00b0, which seems too big. Then I tried subtracting the two results \u2014 155\u00b0 \u2212 70\u00b0 = 85\u00b0 \u2014 and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s 85\u00b0.\"*\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **That\u2019s amazing** \u2014 you're not just guessing.  \nYou're **testing ideas**, **checking for sense**, and even **noticing that 225\u00b0 doesn\u2019t make sense**.  \nThat\u2019s exactly how real math thinking happens.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through what you did \u2014 and why it matters.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d What You Did (Step by Step)\n\n1. **Added the known angles**:  \n   $$\n   25^\\circ + 110^\\circ = 135^\\circ\n   $$  \n   \u2705 This is correct and a great start.\n\n2. **Then tried subtracting each angle from 180\u00b0**:  \n   - $180^\\circ - 25^\\circ = 155^\\circ$  \n   - $180^\\circ - 110^\\circ = 70^\\circ$  \n   \u2705 These are valid *individual remainders*, but\u2026\n\n3. **Then added them**:  \n   $$\n   155^\\circ + 70^\\circ = 225^\\circ\n   $$  \n   \u274c This is **not** the missing angle \u2014 and it\u2019s **not** how the rule works.\n\n4. **Then tried subtracting the two remainders**:  \n   $$\n   155^\\circ - 70^\\circ = 85^\\circ\n   $$  \n   \ud83d\udea8 This is **not a valid method** either \u2014 it doesn\u2019t follow any logical rule of angle sums.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Why This Approach Doesn\u2019t Work (And Why It\u2019s a Common Mistake)\n\nLet\u2019s clarify with a **simple analogy**:\n\n> Imagine a pizza that is **exactly 180\u00b0** in size.  \n> You eat **25\u00b0** of it and **110\u00b0** of it.  \n> So you\u2019ve eaten a total of $25^\\circ + 110^\\circ = 135^\\circ$.  \n> That means the **remaining piece** (the missing angle) is:  \n> $$\n> 180^\\circ - 135^\\circ = \\boxed{45^\\circ}\n> $$\n\n\u2705 That\u2019s the correct answer \u2014 and it makes perfect sense.\n\nNow, if you instead said:  \n> \u201cI had 155\u00b0 left after eating 25\u00b0, and 70\u00b0 left after eating 110\u00b0, so I have 225\u00b0 of leftover pizza?\u201d  \n\u274c That\u2019s like saying:  \n> \u201cI had 155\u00b0 of pizza left *after* eating 25\u00b0, and 70\u00b0 after eating 110\u00b0 \u2014 so I have 225\u00b0 of pizza left?\u201d  \n\ud83d\udc49 That\u2019s impossible \u2014 you can\u2019t have more than one piece of pizza left if you\u2019ve already eaten some.\n\nAnd if you then said:  \n> \u201cSo the missing piece is 155\u00b0 \u2212 70\u00b0 = 85\u00b0?\u201d  \n\ud83d\udc49 That\u2019s like saying:  \n> \u201cThe leftover after eating 25\u00b0 was 155\u00b0, but after eating 110\u00b0 it was 70\u00b0 \u2014 so the difference is 85\u00b0 \u2014 that must be the missing piece?\u201d  \n\u274c That\u2019s not how it works. The missing piece isn\u2019t a *difference* \u2014 it\u2019s what\u2019s **left when you take away the known parts**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 The Correct Way (Reinforced & Clear)\n\n> \ud83d\udd11 **Rule**:  \n> To find the missing angle in a triangle when two are known:  \n> $$\n> \\text{Missing angle} = 180^\\circ - (\\text{Angle 1} + \\text{Angle 2})\n> $$\n\nSo for your problem:\n\n- Known angles: $25^\\circ$ and $110^\\circ$\n- Step 1: Add them  \n  $$\n  25^\\circ + 110^\\circ = 135^\\circ\n  $$\n- Step 2:",
