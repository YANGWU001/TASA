Given the student\u2019s **low proficiency (40% mastery)**, **high forgetting (0.44)**, and **no recent practice**, the goal of the first practice question should be:\n\n- **Clear and simple**  \n- **Focused on foundational understanding**  \n- **Reinforces core concept** (what perimeter is and how to calculate it for basic shapes)  \n- **Builds confidence with a low-stakes, visual, and concrete example**  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**What is the perimeter of a rectangle that is 5 cm long and 3 cm wide?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: Add up all the sides.

Let's go step by step \u2014 with clarity, encouragement, and precision \u2014 to support the student\u2019s learning journey.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Your Answer: \"About 18 cm\" \u2014 Let's Check It!\n\nYou said:  \n> *\"If the length becomes 7 cm and the width stays 3 cm, I\u2019d say the perimeter is about 18 cm.\"*\n\nThat\u2019s a great start \u2014 and you're thinking like a problem-solver! Let's verify it together.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\nWe have a rectangle with:\n- **Length = 7 cm**  \n- **Width = 3 cm**\n\nA rectangle has **two pairs of equal sides**:\n- Two lengths (7 cm each)\n- Two widths (3 cm each)\n\nSo, we add all four sides:\n\n$$\n7 + 3 + 7 + 3 = ?\n$$\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n- $7 + 3 = 10$\n- $7 + 3 = 10$\n- $10 + 10 = 20$\n\n\u2705 So, the **perimeter is 20 cm**, not 18 cm.\n\n> \ud83d\udea9 Your estimate of \"about 18 cm\" is close \u2014 you were just a little off in the addition. That\u2019s completely normal when we're building confidence. The key is to **double-check** using the same method we used before.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why the answer is 20 cm:\n\nLet\u2019s use the shortcut formula to confirm:\n\n$$\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width})  \n= 2 \\times (7 + 3)  \n= 2 \\times 10  \n= 20 \\text{ cm}\n$$\n\n\u2705 Same answer! This confirms that the perimeter is **20 cm**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc What Happened?  \nWhen the length increased from 5 cm to 7 cm (an increase of 2 cm), the perimeter increased from **16 cm to 20 cm** \u2014 that\u2019s a **4 cm increase**.  \nThis makes sense because each side adds to the total distance around the shape.\n\n> \ud83d\udd0d **Key insight**: *Changing one side changes the perimeter \u2014 and you can see how much by adding the difference to the total.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Next Step: Build Confidence with a Simple Square\n\nSince the student is still building foundational understanding and has a **high forgetting score**, it's a great idea to introduce a **new shape** that reinforces the **same core idea** \u2014 but in a simpler, more intuitive way.\n\nLet\u2019s try a **square**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Next Question:\n\n**What is the perimeter of a square that is 4 cm on each side?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: All four sides are equal. Just add them up \u2014 or multiply the side length by 4.*\n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n- A **square** is a simpler shape than a rectangle \u2014 all sides are equal.\n- It reinforces the idea of **adding all sides** without having to worry about length vs. width.\n- It gives the student a chance to practice the concept with **no confusion** \u2014 just repetition and clarity.\n- It\u2019s a natural next step after rectangles, and it helps build **general understanding** of perimeter.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Visual Sketch (described):\n\n```\n+--------+\n|        |\n|        |  \u2190 4 cm\n|        |\n+--------+\n     4 cm\n```\n\nAll sides are 4 cm \u2192 Perimeter = $4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16$ cm  \nOr: $4 \\times 4 = 16$ cm\n\n\u2705 Answer: **16 cm**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 What to do now:\n1. Ask the student to **solve the square question** using the \u201cadd all sides\u201d method.\n2. Once they\u2019ve done it, **check their answer** and praise their effort.\n3. Then, briefly explain:  \n   > \u201cEven though the shape is different, the rule is the same \u2014 perimeter is the total distance around the outside.\u201d\n\nThis will help the student see that **perimeter applies to all shapes**, not just rectangles.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to generate the **final answer** and a **summary reflection** for the student to review?
