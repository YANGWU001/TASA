Given the student's **low mastery (\u224820%)**, **moderate forgetting (0.22)**, and persistent difficulty with discount problems \u2014 despite a recent \"ace\" \u2014 it's clear they need a **clear, foundational, and low-pressure** practice question that reinforces the core concept without overwhelming them.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Goal of the First Practice Question:\n- Focus on **basic discount calculation** (original price \u2192 discounted price).\n- Use **real-world context** to make it relatable.\n- Avoid complex multi-step problems or wordy scenarios.\n- Emphasize **clear steps** (find discount amount, subtract from original price).\n- Reinforce that **\"discount\" means a reduction**, not a percentage of the final price.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**A shirt originally costs $40. It is on sale with a 25% discount. What is the sale price of the shirt?**\n\n> \ud83d\udd0d *Hint: First, find 25% of $40. Then subtract that amount from the original price.*\n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n- **Simple numbers** (25% of 40 = 10) \u2192 easy to compute mentally.\n- **Direct application** of the discount formula:  \n  **Sale Price = Original Price \u2212 (Discount % \u00d7 Original Price)**\n- Builds confidence with a **clear path** to the answer.\n- Allows the student to **feel successful** without pressure.\n- After solving, we can follow up with a slightly harder problem or a \"reverse\" question (e.g., \"A pair of shoes costs $60 after a 20% discount. What was the original price?\") to build deeper understanding.\n\nLet me know when they\u2019ve tried it \u2014 I\u2019ll be ready to guide next steps! \ud83d\udca1",
