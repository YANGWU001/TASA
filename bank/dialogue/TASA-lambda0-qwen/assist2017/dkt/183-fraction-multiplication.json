Given the student\u2019s **low mastery (~38%)** and **high forgetting score (~0.42)** in fraction multiplication, it\u2019s clear that they are experiencing significant knowledge loss\u2014despite recent practice. This suggests the student needs a **clear, concrete, and low-pressure** starting point to rebuild confidence and reinforce foundational understanding.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Goal of First Practice Question:\n- Focus on **simple, familiar fraction multiplication** (same denominators or easy numerators).\n- Avoid complexity or abstract concepts.\n- Emphasize **step-by-step reasoning** (e.g., \u201cmultiply numerators, multiply denominators\u201d).\n- Build confidence with a **visual or intuitive anchor** (like real-world context).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**What is \u00bd \u00d7 \u00bc?**\n\n> *Hint: Multiply the numerators (top numbers) and multiply the denominators (bottom numbers).

And here\u2019s why:\n\nWe simplify a fraction when the **numerator and denominator share a common factor** (a number that divides both evenly).\n\nLet\u2019s look at **2 and 6**:\n- Factors of 2: 1, 2  \n- Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6  \n\u2192 The **greatest common factor (GCF)** is **2**\n\nSo we divide **both numerator and denominator by 2**:\n- 2 \u00f7 2 = 1  \n- 6 \u00f7 2 = 3  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 So:  \n**2/6 = 1/3**\n\n\u2705 This is the **simplified form** \u2014 and it\u2019s the **final answer** we should give.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Why does this matter?\n\n- **2/6** is mathematically correct \u2014 it\u2019s the result of multiplying the fractions.\n- But **1/3** is the *simplest form* \u2014 it\u2019s easier to understand, work with, and remember.\n- In math, we always **simplify fractions when possible** \u2014 just like we reduce a mixed number or cancel common terms in multiplication.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Think of it like sharing cookies:\n- If you have 2 out of 6 equal slices of a cookie, that\u2019s **half** of a third of the whole \u2014 so it\u2019s the same as **1/3** of the whole cookie.  \n\u2192 So 2/6 = 1/3 \u2192 makes sense!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Real-world anchor:\nImagine you have **\u00bd of a chocolate bar**, and you take **\u2154 of that half**.  \nHow much of the whole chocolate bar do you now have?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 You have **1/3** of the whole bar \u2014 because:\n- \u00bd \u00d7 \u2154 = 1/3  \n\u2192 That\u2019s a familiar, intuitive result \u2014 and it fits with what we know about multiplying fractions less than 1.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n> **\u00bd \u00d7 \u2154 = 1/3**  \n(We started with 2/6 and simplified it to 1/3)\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **You did it!**  \nYou used the correct method, noticed the need to simplify, and even *explained* it \u2014 that\u2019s a huge step forward!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (to build confidence and reinforce the pattern):\n\n> **What is \u2153 \u00d7 \u2154?**\n\n> \ud83d\udcdd *Hint: Multiply the numerators (top numbers) and the denominators (bottom numbers).

Maybe we can cancel a 2? No, there\u2019s no 2 in the bottom, so I guess it stays **2/9**.  \n> Or\u2026 maybe we\u2019re supposed to do something different, like add the denominators instead of multiplying them? If we did 3 + 3 = 6, then we\u2019d get 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3.\"\n\n\ud83d\udc4f **You\u2019re absolutely right to question that!** And your instinct to **double-check** whether adding denominators is correct is *exactly* what strong math thinkers do.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct Approach: Multiply Numerators & Denominators\n\nYes!  \nWhen multiplying fractions:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Multiply the top numbers (numerators)**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Multiply the bottom numbers (denominators)**  \n\nSo:  \n- \u2153 \u00d7 \u2154 = (1 \u00d7 2) / (3 \u00d7 3) = **2/9**\n\n\u2705 That\u2019s **correct** \u2014 and you got it!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Do we simplify 2/9?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n- Factors of 2: 1, 2  \n- Factors of 9: 1, 3, 9  \n\u2192 The **only common factor is 1**\n\nSo, **2/9 cannot be simplified further**.\n\n\u2705 Final answer: **2/9**\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Why adding denominators is a common mistake (but not correct here):\n\nSome students think:  \n> \"If I have 1/3 and I take 2/3 of it, maybe I just add the denominators?\"  \n\u2192 That\u2019s a misconception \u2014 **adding denominators is not how multiplication works**.\n\nThink of it this way:\n- Multiplying fractions is like **taking a part of a part**.\n- 1/3 of something is a *small piece*.\n- Taking 2/3 of *that* piece means you\u2019re shrinking it even more \u2014 so the result should be **smaller than 1/3**, but not equal to 2/6 or 1/3.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n- 1/3 = 3/9  \n- 2/9 is **less than** 3/9 \u2192 makes sense!  \n\u2192 So 2/9 is indeed smaller than 1/3 \u2014 which fits with taking *part of a part*.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Real-world anchor:  \nImagine you have **1/3 of a pizza**, and you eat **2/3 of that slice**.  \nHow much of the whole pizza do you now have?  \n\ud83d\udc49 You have **2/9** of the whole pizza \u2014 that\u2019s a small amount \u2014 and it makes sense!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf What\u2019s the takeaway?\n\n> \u2705 To multiply two fractions:  \n> **Multiply numerators \u00d7 numerators**  \n> **Multiply denominators \u00d7 denominators**  \n> \u2705 Then **simplify if possible** (only if numerator and denominator share a common factor)\n\n> \ud83d\udd01 This pattern holds every time \u2014 even with different numbers.\n\nYou\u2019ve now practiced **three multiplication problems**:\n1. \u2154 \u00d7 \u2153 = **2/9**  \n2. \u00bd \u00d7 \u2154 = **1/3**  \n3. \u2153 \u00d7 \u2154 = **2/9**\n\nAnd you\u2019ve seen how simplifying helps make answers clearer and more meaningful.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (to reinforce the pattern and build confidence):\n\n> **What is \u2154 \u00d7 \u2154?**\n\n> \ud83d\udcdd *Hint: Multiply the numerators (top numbers) and the denominators (bottom numbers). Then simplify if needed.*\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip:  \n- Numerator: 2 \u00d7 2 = ?  \n- Denominator: 3 \u00d7 3 = ?  \n- You\u2019ll get a fraction \u2014 see if it can be simplified!  \n- This one is a little more advanced \u2014 but you\u2019ve got this!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This one is a great \"aha!\" moment:  \nYou\u2019ll get **4/9**, which *cannot be simplified* \u2014 and it\u2019s a perfect example of **multiplying a fraction by itself**.\n\nIt also shows how **multiplying fractions less than 1 gives results smaller than the",
