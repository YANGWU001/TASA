And you\u2019re doing that beautifully!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Let\u2019s Be Precise: What is \u201cWhat percent of 90 is 45\u201d?\n\nYou said:\n> \"45 \u00f7 90 = 0.5\" \u2014 \u2705 **Perfect!**\n\nNow, remember the **percent formula**:\n> **Percent = (Part \u00f7 Whole) \u00d7 100**\n\nSo:\n$$\n\\frac{45}{90} = 0.5\n$$\n$$\n0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\%\n$$\n\n\u2705 Final answer: **50%**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 What You Might Have Confused (and Why It\u2019s Okay):\nYou asked:  \n> *\"If I move the decimal point two places, .5 becomes 50%?\"* \u2014 \ud83c\udfaf **YES!** That\u2019s correct!\n\nBut you also said:  \n> *\"Maybe I\u2019m supposed to write that as 0.5%?\"* \u2014 \u274c That\u2019s a common mix-up.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify:\n\n- **0.5** is the decimal form of **half**.\n- **0.5%** would mean **0.005**, which is *only 0.5 percent* \u2014 way too small!\n- But **50%** means **50 out of 100** \u2014 which is exactly half.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So:  \n- **0.5** \u2192 **50%**  \n- Not **0.5%** \u2192 that\u2019s a *mistake* in the decimal-to-percent conversion.\n\n\u2705 Think of it this way:  \n- To convert a decimal to a percent, you **multiply by 100** \u2014 or **move the decimal point two places to the right**.  \n- So:  \n  - 0.5 \u2192 0.50 \u2192 50.0% \u2192 **50%** \u2705  \n  - 0.1 \u2192 10%  \n  - 0.25 \u2192 25%  \n  - 0.75 \u2192 75%\n\nSo yes \u2014 **you were right to think about decimals** \u2014 just need to remember:  \n> \ud83d\udd01 **Decimal \u2192 Percent**: Multiply by 100 (or move decimal two places right)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Final Answer:\n> What percent of 90 is 45?  \n> \u2192 $ \\frac{45}{90} = 0.5 $  \n> \u2192 $ 0.5 \\times 100 = 50\\% $  \n> \u2705 **Answer: 50%**\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Why it makes sense**:  \n- 45 is **exactly half** of 90 \u2192 so it must be **50%**  \n- 50% of 90 = $ 0.5 \\times 90 = 45 $ \u2705  \n- This is a **common pattern** \u2014 when a number is half of the whole, the percent is always **50%**\n\nYou were *almost* there \u2014 and that\u2019s how learning works: **you make a small mistake, reflect, correct it, and grow stronger**.\n\n\ud83d\udc4f Keep going \u2014 you're not just solving problems.  \nYou're building **number sense**, **confidence**, and **mathematical intuition** \u2014 all of which are what mastery truly is.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to build fluency and reinforce key patterns):\n\n> What percent of **120 is 60**?\n\n**Instructions:**  \nUse the same steps:  \n1.
