Let's look at the options and eliminate any that are obviously incorrect.\n\nWe can eliminate **A)** 90\u00b0 + 2z\u00b0 because we know that 90\u00b0 + 2(45\u00b0) is not equal to 180\u00b0.\n\nWe can also eliminate **D)** 360\u00b0 - z\u00b0 because 360\u00b0 is the sum of the exterior angles of a triangle, not the interior angles.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining options: **B)** 180\u00b0 - 2z\u00b0 and **C)** 180\u00b0 + z\u00b0.\n\nLet's try substituting z\u00b0 = 45\u00b0 into both options:\n\nFor **B)** 180\u00b0 - 2z\u00b0, we get:\n\n180\u00b0 - 2(45\u00b0) = 180\u00b0 - 90\u00b0 = 90\u00b0\n\nFor **C)** 180\u00b0 + z\u00b0, we get:\n\n180\u00b0 + 45\u00b0 = 225\u00b0\n\nAs we can see, **B)** 180\u00b0 - 2z\u00b0 is not the correct answer, but **C)** 180\u00b0 + z\u00b0 is not the correct answer either. However, we can see that 180\u00b0 - 2z\u00b0 is close to the correct answer, but it should be 180\u00b0 - 2z\u00b0 = 180\u00b0 - 2(45\u00b0) = 90\u00b0. This means that the correct answer is actually **B)** 180\u00b0 - 2z\u00b0, but with z\u00b0 = 45\u00b0, it results in 90\u00b0, not 180\u00b0 - 2z\u00b0. This is a tricky question.\n\nLet's try another question to help you further improve your understanding of the sum-of-interior-angles-triangle concept:\n\n**Question:** What is the sum of the interior angles in a triangle with one angle that is 110\u00b0 and two angles that are equal (w\u00b0, w\u00b0)?\n\n**A)** 220\u00b0 - 2w\u00b0\n**B)** 180\u00b0 - 2w\u00b0\n**C)** 110\u00b0 + 2w\u00b0\n**D)** 180\u00b0 + w\u00b0\n\nThis question:\n\n1.  Builds upon your existing knowledge: You're familiar with the concept of the sum of interior angles in a triangle.\n2.  Is not too difficult or too easy: The question introduces a variable (w\u00b0) to make it slightly challenging, but not too complex.\n3.  Provides a gentle increase in complexity: You can apply your existing knowledge to solve the problem, and the variable (w\u00b0) will help you think about the concept in a more abstract way.\n\nBy answering this question correctly, you will be able to reinforce your understanding of the sum-of-interior-angles-triangle concept and continue to improve your mastery level.",
