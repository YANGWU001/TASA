Let's go through the correct solution together.\n\nTo find the number of combinations of 3 toppings from 5, we use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!). \n\nHere, n = 5 (total number of toppings) and k = 3 (number of toppings to choose).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the factorial of each number:\n- n! (5!) = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 120\n- k! (3!) = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 = 6\n- (n-k)!

    "content": "You're on the right track with the number of possible selections of 1, 2, or 3 toppings. However, let's break it down further to understand why we need to consider these cases.\n\nWhen a customer orders a pizza, there are three possible scenarios:\n\n1. They choose 1 topping.\n2. They choose 2 toppings.\n3. They choose 3 toppings.\n\nFor each scenario, we need to calculate the number of possible combinations of toppings.\n\n1. Choosing 1 topping: There are 5 different toppings, so there are 5 ways to choose 1 topping.\n\n2. Choosing 2 toppings: We can use the combination formula to calculate this. We have 5 toppings, and we want to choose 2 of them. The number of ways to do this is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!\\,3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\n3. Choosing 3 toppings: Similarly, we can use the combination formula to calculate this. We have 5 toppings, and we want to choose 3 of them. The number of ways to do this is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!\\,2!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10\n\\]\n\nNow, let's add up the number of possible combinations for each scenario:\n\nTotal number of combinations = 5 (1 topping) + 10 (2 toppings) + 10 (3 toppings) = 25\n\nYou're correct that the total number of possible combinations is 25.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this problem can also be solved using the concept of combinations with repetition. Since a pizza can have a maximum of 3 toppings, we can think of this as choosing 3 items from a set of 5 items, allowing for repetition. The formula for combinations with repetition is:\n\n\\[\nC(n+k-1, k) = \\frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!(n-1)!}\n\\]\n\nIn this case, n = 5 (number of toppings) and k = 3 (number of toppings to choose). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nC(5+3-1, 3) = C(7, 3) = \\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 35\n\\]\n\nHowever, this includes the \"no-topping\" case, which we don't want to count. To exclude this case, we subtract 1 from the result:\n\n35 - 1 = 34\n\nBut we can also use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 0 toppings:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{0} = \\frac{5!}{0!\\,5!} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo the total number of possible combinations is 34 + 1 = 35, but we counted 1 combination more, which is the combination of 0 toppings. Therefore, the correct total number of possible combinations is 34.\n\nNow, let's move on to the next question.\n\n**Question:** A bag contains 12 red marbles, 8 blue marbles, and 6 green marbles.

We've already worked through the first part of this problem, and we found that the probability of drawing 3 marbles of the same color is \\(\\frac{37}{325}\\).\n\nHowever, let's consider a new scenario.
