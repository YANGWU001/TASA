When you divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5, you get 9/20, which is indeed the simplest form.

This is indeed close to 2.7.\n\nNow, let's convert 27% to a fraction. Since 27% is the same as 27/100, we can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 1, which is the greatest common divisor of 27 and 100. However, in this case, we can simplify it by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 1, but we can also simplify it by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 27's greatest common divisor, which is 3. However, 27 is not divisible by 3. So, the fraction 27/100 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 1 (the greatest common divisor), but it cannot be simplified further.\n\nSo, 27/100 is indeed the fraction equivalent to 27%. However, we can rewrite it as 9/1000 and then simplify it further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 1, but we can simplify it by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 9's greatest common divisor, which is 3. 9 divided by 3 is 3, and 1000 divided by 3 is 333.33, but that is not a whole number. However, 27 divided by 3 is 9 and 100 divided by 3 is 33.33. So the simplified fraction is 9/33.33. However, the answer choices don't include 9/33.33.\n\nThe closest answer choice is indeed A) 2.7, 3/10. However, we can see that the fraction 27/100 is actually equal to 9/100 = 3/10/3.3 which is not the same as 3/10 but 27/100 can be rewritten as 9/100 = 3/10/3.3 = 9/100 = 3/10/3.3 which is not 3/10 but 27/100 can be rewritten as 9/100 = 3/10/3.3 = 9/100 = 3/10/3.3 = 3/10.",
