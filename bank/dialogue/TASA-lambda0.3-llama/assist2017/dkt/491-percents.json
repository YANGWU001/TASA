Let's break down their thought process and identify areas where they need more practice and clarification.\n\nThe student correctly simplified 25% to 25/100, which reduces to 1/4. They then multiplied 1/4 by 180, which is correct. However, they seem to be getting confused and doubting their result.\n\nOne area of improvement is in the student's understanding of equivalent fractions and decimals. They correctly converted 25% to 1/4, but then also converted it to 0.25. However, they didn't use the decimal form consistently throughout their calculation.\n\nLet's clarify that when you multiply 0.25 by 180, you get 45. This is because 0.25 is equivalent to 1/4, and multiplying 1/4 by 180 is the same as multiplying 45 by 4 (since 1/4 is the same as 4/16, and 180 is the same as 7200/40, or 1800/10, or 360/2, or 180).\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's focus on using equivalent fractions or decimals consistently throughout the calculation.
