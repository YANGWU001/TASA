    "content": "Based on the student's profile and recent learning events, I've created a practice question that should help build their understanding of the discount concept, taking into account their current knowledge level and areas for improvement.\n\n**Question:** \n\nMaria is buying a shirt on sale. The original price of the shirt is $25. If she gets a 15% discount, how much will she pay for the shirt?\n\nA) $20.75\nB) $22.50\nC) $21.25\nD) $23.75\nE) $25.00\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n- The student has shown limited mastery of the discount concept, so I've chosen a simple, straightforward problem that involves a basic percentage discount.\n- The student has a moderate forgetting score, indicating they may need a refresher on applying the concept. This question requires them to apply the discount concept to a real-world scenario.\n- The discount amount is 15%, which is a relatively small percentage, making it easier for the student to calculate.\n- The question is multiple-choice, allowing the student to practice their understanding without feeling overwhelmed by a complex problem.\n\n**Expected outcome:**\n\nI expect the student to struggle with this question initially, as they still need to improve their understanding of the discount concept. However, with the correct guidance and feedback, they should be able to apply the concept correctly and arrive at the answer. This question will help assess their current understanding and provide a stepping stone for further learning and improvement.",

    "content": "**Explanation of the student's last answer:**\n\nThe student attempted to calculate the discount by finding 25% of $100, which is a great start. However, the student correctly calculated 25% of $100 as $25. Then, they applied the second discount by finding 5% of the sale price, which is $75. However, the student made an error in calculating 5% of $75, which is actually $3.75, not mentioned. After subtracting $3.75 from $75, the student should get $71.25. The correct answer is indeed $71.25.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\nYou're doing great, and it's fantastic that you're thinking critically about your calculations! Remember, it's okay to make mistakes, and it's even better that you're double-checking your work. In this case, your initial calculation was mostly correct, but you didn't complete the calculation for the second discount. To improve, try to be more precise when calculating the second discount, and make sure to round your answers accordingly.\n\n**Next question:**\n\nA shirt originally costs $120. If it's on sale for a 30% discount, and then you have a coupon for an additional 15% off the sale price, how much will you pay for the shirt?\n\nA) $76.80\nB) $78\nC) $81\nD) $84\nE) $86\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n- I've chosen a moderate original price to make the calculation more challenging, but not too difficult.\n- The discount percentages are moderate to high, which will help the student practice applying the discount concept to a scenario with multiple discounts.\n- This question requires the student to apply the discount concept to a new scenario, helping them generalize their understanding and practice applying multiple discounts.\n- The multiple-choice options provide a range of possible answers, allowing the student to practice their understanding without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThis question will help the student practice applying the discount concept to a moderate scenario with multiple discounts and build on their previous understanding.",
