The numbers used are relatively simple, making it accessible to the student's current level of understanding.\n3.

    "content": "**Explanation of Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's answer of 16 meters for the perimeter of the garden is close, but not quite correct. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to add the lengths of all four sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the length is 6 meters and the width is 4 meters. \n\nSo, let's plug these values into the formula: P = 2(6) + 2(4). First, multiply the length and width by 2: 2(6) = 12 and 2(4) = 8. Then, add these two values together: 12 + 8 = 20. Therefore, the correct perimeter of the garden is 20 meters. The student's answer of 16 meters was close, but not accurate. \n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question 2:**\n\nA swimming pool has a length of 8 meters and a width of 5 meters.
