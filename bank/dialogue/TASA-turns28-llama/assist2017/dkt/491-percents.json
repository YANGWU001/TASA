To find the amount you'll save, you need to calculate 15% of $25. Since you remembered that 10% of $25 is $2.50, you're on the right track, but you need to multiply that by 1.5 (since 15% is 1.5 times 10%). So, 15% of $25 would be $2.50 x 1.5 = $3.75.\n\n**The correct answer is B) $3.75.**\n\nDon't worry if you got it wrong \u2013 it's all part of the learning process.

You're correct in thinking that the bakery might round down, but in this case, the correct approach is to choose the answer that's closest to your calculation.

I think I\u2019m supposed to find 15\u202f% of $100 first.  \n\n$15\u202f%$ as a decimal is\u2026 uh\u2026 I think it\u2019s 0.15 (since 15\u202f%\u202f=\u202f15\u2044100\u202f=\u202f0.15).  \n\nThen I multiply: $100\u202f\u00d7\u202f0.15\u202f=\u202f$15.  \n\nSo the discount should be $15, right?  \n\nIf I subtract that from the original price: $100\u202f\u2212\u202f$15\u202f=\u202f$85.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m supposed to subtract the discount or maybe add something extra for tax or something. The answer choices are $85.00, $85.50, $86.00, and $86.50.  \n\nI think maybe the discount is $14.50 instead of $15? If I take 10\u202f% of $100 I get $10, and 5\u202f% would be half of that, $5, so together that\u2019s $15\u2026 hmm, maybe I\u2019m over\u2011thinking it.  \n\nOkay, I\u2019m leaning toward **$85.50** (choice B) because I feel like the discount might be a little less than $15, maybe $14.50, which would leave $85.50.  \n\nSo\u2026"

    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYou're making a great effort to break down the problem step by step. You correctly identified 15% as 0.15 and multiplied $100 by 0.15 to find the discount, which is indeed $15. However, you're overthinking it by considering the possibility of an additional tax or extra amount. In this case, you've already found the correct discount, which is $15.\n\nTo find the final price, you correctly subtracted $15 from $100, getting $85. You're also considering the answer choices, which is great. However, the correct answer is indeed $85.00, choice A) $85.00. The other options are incorrect.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\n**Question 13:**\n\nA store offers a 25% discount on all items.

The discount is a common scenario where you can apply your understanding of percents to real-life situations.\n3.  The question has a straightforward calculation, making it accessible for a student with a low mastery level.\n4.  The answer choices are clear and distinct, allowing you to make an informed decision.\n\nThis question is designed to help you practice calculating a percentage of a given number, and it's a bit more challenging than the previous question. You can use your previous knowledge to find the correct answer. Take your time, and think about how you can apply your understanding of percents to solve this problem.",
