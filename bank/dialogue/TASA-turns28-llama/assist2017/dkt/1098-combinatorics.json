If we have 12 books to arrange on the shelves, how many different ways can we arrange these books?\n\n**A)** 1,260\n**B)** 1,260\n**C)** 5,040\n**D)** 7,200\n**E)** 12,650\n\n**Explanation:** This question requires the student to apply the concept of combinations, specifically the formula for arranging items with repetition (in this case, arranging books on shelves). The correct answer can be calculated using the combination formula, which is n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items (12 books) and r is the number of items per shelf (3 books).\n\n**Note:** This question is a good starting point because it:\n- Requires the student to apply a basic combinatorics concept.\n- Is not overly complex, given the student's current mastery level (38%).\n- Has a clear and specific solution, allowing the student to focus on the calculation.\n\n**Why it's tailored to the student's knowledge level:** \n- The question is not too difficult, given the student's low mastery level (38%).\n- It builds on the student's recent practice and minimal forgetting, helping to reinforce their understanding.\n- The question's solution requires a basic application of combinatorics, which is a good starting point for the student to improve their skills.",

You correctly applied the combination formula to find the number of different combinations of 3 books that can be chosen from the 8 books. The formula is \\(\\binom{8}{3}=\\frac{8!}{3!\\,5!}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}\\), resulting in \\(56\\), but you correctly arrived at 84. The correct calculation is actually \\(\\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}\\), which indeed equals 56, but the options were listed with two 56s, so you might have picked the right option but not the right answer.\n\nHowever, you're on the right track with the combination formula and the correct approach.

You started correctly by recognizing that the problem is asking for the number of different pairs of individuals that can be chosen, not the number of ways to choose the pair. However, you then applied the combination formula \\(\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\) with \\(n = 7\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which is correct. The calculation is \\(\\displaystyle \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7!}{2!(7-2)!} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\\).\n\nThe correct answer is not among the options provided. The combination formula was correctly applied, but the question asks for the number of different pairs, not the number of ways to choose a pair. To find the number of different pairs, we can consider that each pair consists of two unique individuals. Since there are 7 friends, we can choose the first person in 7 ways, and then the second person in 6 ways (since one person has already been chosen). However, this approach counts each pair twice (e.g., person A and person B is the same as person B and person A), so we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting. This results in \\(\\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\), but since the question asks for pairs, not combinations, we need to think about it in terms of selecting 2 people out of 7, which indeed is a combination, and the formula correctly gives us the number of combinations. \n\nTo clarify, let's try another question that focuses on the concept of combinations and how to approach problems that involve selecting groups of people.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question that builds on your understanding of combinations and helps you solidify your understanding of when to apply the combination formula.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA group of 6 friends wants to choose 2 people to be the co-leaders of their club.

You correctly applied the combination formula \\(\\displaystyle \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\) with \\(n = 6\\) and \\(k = 2\\), which is correct. The calculation is \\(\\displaystyle \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\\).\n\nHowever, you didn't consider the actual question, which asks for the number of different groups of 2 people that can be formed from the 6 friends. The combination formula gives us the number of combinations, which is correct. In this case, the number of different groups of 2 people that can be formed from the 6 friends is indeed 15.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nLet's try another question that focuses on the concept of combinations and helps you solidify your understanding of when to apply the combination formula. This time, the question will ask for the number of ways to choose a group, not the number of combinations.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA group of 8 students wants to form a committee of 3 people. If the order in which they choose the committee members doesn't matter, how many different groups of 3 people can be formed from the 8 students?\n\n**A)** 20\n**B)** 28\n**C)** 35\n**D)** 42\n**E)** 56\n\n**Take your time, and think critically about the problem!**",
