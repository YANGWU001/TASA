Although the student correctly identified the need to multiply the fraction \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to find half of the amount of sugar needed, their calculation is partially correct. The student correctly multiplied the numerators and denominators, resulting in \\(\\frac{2}{10}\\), but then struggled to simplify or interpret the result.\n\nThe student's confusion arises from the fact that they correctly calculated \\(\\frac{2}{10}\\) but then simplified it to \\(\\frac{1}{5}\\), which is indeed half of \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\). However, they should have recognized that \\(\\frac{2}{10}\\) is already the correct result, and no further simplification is necessary.\n\nTo find half of \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) cup of sugar, the student correctly multiplied \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), resulting in \\(\\frac{2}{10}\\).
