Let\u2019s look together at where the little slip happened and then finish the problem correctly.  \n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Where the \u201ctens\u2011plus\u2011ones\u201d got mixed up  \n\n| Angle | Tens part | Ones part |\n|------|-----------|----------|\n| \\(73^\\circ\\) | \\(70^\\circ\\) | \\(3^\\circ\\) |\n| \\(58^\\circ\\) | **\\(50^\\circ\\)** | \\(8^\\circ\\) |\n\nYou wrote **\\(40^\\circ\\)** for the tens of \\(58^\\circ\\). The correct tens are **\\(50^\\circ\\)** (because 58 = 50\u202f+\u202f8).  \nThat\u2019s the only place the numbers changed, so let\u2019s redo the addition with the right tens.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step\u202f1 \u2013 Add the two given angles (again)\n\n1. **Add the tens**  \n   \\[\n   70^\\circ + 50^\\circ = 120^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the ones**  \n   \\[\n   3^\\circ + 8^\\circ = 11^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine**  \n   \\[\n   120^\\circ + 11^\\circ = 131^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n**So the sum of the known angles is \\(131^\\circ\\).**  \n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step\u202f2 \u2013 Subtract that sum from\u202f\\(180^\\circ\\)\n\nWe need \\(180^\\circ - 131^\\circ\\).  \nYou already tried the borrowing method, which is great \u2013 let\u2019s see it with the correct numbers.\n\n```\n  180\n\u2011 131\n------\n```\n\n* **Units column:** 0\u202f\u2013\u202f1 can\u2019t be done, so we **borrow** 1 ten from the \u201c8\u201d (the \u201c80\u201d becomes \u201c70\u201d). The 0 becomes 10.  \n  \u2192\u202f10\u202f\u2013\u202f1 = **9** (write 9 in the units place).\n\n* **Tens column:** after borrowing we have 7\u202f\u2013\u202f3 = **4**.\n\n* **Hundreds column:** 1\u202f\u2013\u202f1 = **0**.\n\nPutting the pieces together gives **\\(49^\\circ\\)**.\n\n### Quick\u2011check (the habit we love)\n\nAdd the three angles back together:\n\n\\[\n73^\\circ + 58^\\circ + 49^\\circ = (73^\\circ + 58^\\circ) + 49^\\circ = 131^\\circ + 49^\\circ = 180^\\circ.\n\\]\n\nBecause we get the original total, the subtraction is correct.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf89 What you\u2019ve mastered so far\n\n| Skill | How you did it | What to keep doing |\n|-------|----------------|--------------------|\n| Split numbers into tens\u202f+\u202fones | \u2714\ufe0e (just need the right tens for 58\u00b0) | Keep writing the breakdown on paper. |\n| Borrowing in subtraction | \u2714\ufe0e You know the steps! | Double\u2011check the digit you\u2019re borrowing from. |\n| Quick\u2011check by adding back | \u2714\ufe0e You used it before | Make it a habit after every subtraction. |\n\nYou\u2019re right on track \u2013 the only hiccup was the **50\u202f\u00b0 vs. 40\u202f\u00b0** mix\u2011up. That\u2019s an easy thing to spot once you always label the parts (tens\u202f=\u202f\u201cthe digit in the \u2018tens\u2019 place \u00d7\u202f10\u201d).  \n\n---\n\n## \u27a1\ufe0f Your Next Practice Problem\n\nLet\u2019s reinforce the same three\u2011step process with a new set of angles.\n\n> In",
