Convert 70\u202f% to a fraction (or decimal).  \n2. Simplify the fraction if possible.  \n3. Cancel any common factor with 55 before you multiply.  \n4. Multiply and write the answer in a sentence, then do a quick sanity check (e.g., 10\u202f% of 55 is 5.5, so 70\u202f% should be about 7\u202f\u00d7\u202f5.5 \u2248 38.5).\n\n---\n\n### What to do next\n\n- **Write down each step** (you can keep it short).  \n- If you get stuck at any point, just tell me *exactly* where you\u2019re unsure (e.g., \u201cI don\u2019t know how to simplify 70\u2044100\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t see a factor that cancels with 55\u201d).  \n- I\u2019ll give you a targeted hint and we\u2019ll move forward together.\n\nGive it a try, and let me know how it goes! \ud83d\ude80",
