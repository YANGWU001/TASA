Those two cards can be any two of the **remaining 8** cards.  \n4. \\(\\displaystyle\\binom{8}{2}\\) counts *unordered* selections of 2 cards from 8, which is exactly what we need because a hand does **not** care about the order in which the cards are drawn.\n\n---\n\n### What about the \u201cordering\u2019\u2019 concern?\n\nA **binomial coefficient** \\(\\displaystyle\\binom{n}{k}\\) always counts *combinations*\u2014sets where order does **not** matter.  \n\nIf we were counting **ordered** selections (permutations), we would use  \n\n\\[\nP(n,k)=\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\n\\]\n\ninstead. In a hand of cards, the order of the cards inside the hand is irrelevant, so \\(\\binom{8}{2}\\) is the right tool.\n\n---\n\n### Why not \\(\\displaystyle\\binom{8}{3}\\)?\n\n\\(\\displaystyle\\binom{8}{3}\\) would be the number of ways to pick **three** cards *in addition* to the 5, giving a 4\u2011card hand. Since we only need a total of three cards, we only have to choose **two** more after reserving the 5.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Next practice problem (a small step up)\n\n**Problem:**  \nFrom the same 9\u2011card deck, how many different 4\u2011card hands contain **exactly one** card from the set \\(\\{2,5,7\\}\\)?\n\n*Hints to guide you*  \n\n1. **Choose the one special card** \u2013 there are 3 cards in the set \\(\\{2,5,7\\}\\).  \n2. **Choose the remaining three cards** from the other cards that are *not* in \\(\\{2,5,7\\}\\).  \n   - How many cards are left after removing the three special ones?  \n   - Use a binomial coefficient to pick 3 of those.  \n\nWrite your answer as a product of binomial coefficients (and, if you like, evaluate it to a number). Include a one\u2011sentence explanation of why the product counts exactly the hands we want.\n\n---\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, type out your work and reasoning. If any step feels fuzzy, just point it out and we\u2019ll break it down together. Keep it up\u2014you\u2019re turning those combinatorics knots into smooth steps! \ud83d\ude80",
