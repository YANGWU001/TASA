Convert\u202f% to decimal | 25\u202f% = ? | **0.20** | 25\u202f% means \u201c25 out of 100\u201d, so \\(\\frac{25}{100}=0.25\\). A decimal of **0.20** would be **20\u202f%**. |\n| 2. Find\u202f10\u202f% of\u202f\\$120 | 10\u202f% = ? | (blank) | To get 10\u202f% you move the decimal one place left: \\(120 \\rightarrow 12\\). So 10\u202f% of \\$120 is **\\$12**. |\n| 3. Build\u202f25\u202f% from 10\u202f% pieces | Discount = ? | (blank) | 25\u202f% = 10\u202f% + 10\u202f% + 5\u202f%.  \n\u2003\u2022 10\u202f% = \\$12 (from step\u202f2)  \n\u2003\u2022 another 10\u202f% = another \\$12  \n\u2003\u2022 5\u202f% = half of 10\u202f% = \\$6  \n\u2003Add them: \\(12+12+6 = 30\\). So the discount is **\\$30**. |\n| 4. Subtract discount from \\$120 | Sale price = ? | (blank) | \\(120 - 30 = 90\\).
