Convert the percent** | \\(18\\% = \\dfrac{18}{100}=0.18\\) | \u2705  That part is perfect. |\n| **2. Set up the multiplication** | \\(0.18 \\times 120\\) | \u2705  That\u2019s exactly the \u201cone\u2011multiplication\u201d we need. |\n| **3. Do the multiplication** | You split it as \\(0.18 \\times (12 \\times 10) = (0.18 \\times 12)\\times 10\\) and guessed that \\(0.18 \\times 12 \\approx 2.16\\). |  That *guess* is actually right \u2013 let\u2019s see why:  <br> \\(\\displaystyle 0.18 \\times 12 = \\frac{18}{100}\\times 12 = \\frac{18\\times12}{100}= \\frac{216}{100}=2.16\\).  <br>Multiplying by the extra 10 gives \\(2.16 \\times 10 = 21.6\\). |\n| **4. Final answer you wrote** | **22.5** | The extra \u201c0.9\u201d that turned 21.6 into 22.5 came from an **unnecessary extra step** \u2013 it\u2019s easy to slip in a little \u201cadd a bit more\u201d when the number feels \u201clow\u201d. But the recipe tells us to **stop after the single multiplication** (or after the single addition of the shortcut pieces). No extra zero, no extra addition. |\n\n#### \u2705 The correct answer\n\\[\n18\\% \\text{ of } 120 = 0.18 \\times 120 = 21.6\n\\]\n\nSo you were *almost* there! You had the right decimal and the right multiplication; the only mistake was the last \u201cadjust\u2011a\u2011bit\u2011more\u201d that isn\u2019t part of the percent recipe.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccf A quick sanity check\n\nIt helps to picture the answer with familiar benchmarks:\n\n| Percent | Easy way to picture it (for any number) | Value for 120 |\n|---------|------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| 10\u202f%    | Move the decimal one place left          | 12 |\n| 20\u202f%    | Double the 10\u202f% value                    | 24 |\n| 18\u202f%    | A little less than 20\u202f% \u2192 halfway between 12 and 24 | \\((12+24)/2 = 18\\) \u2192 actually 21.6 (because 18\u202f% is 0.9\u202f\u00d7\u202f20\u202f%) |\n\nSeeing that 21.6 sits nicely between 12 (10\u202f%) and 24 (20\u202f%) tells us the answer feels \u201cjust right\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Your next practice problem\n\nNow let\u2019s reinforce the three\u2011step recipe with a new number.\n\n> **Problem:** *What is **23\u202f% of\u202f45**?*  \n\nWrite your answer as a single number (you may keep a decimal if that\u2019s what you get).\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, you can:\n\n* **Show your work** \u2013 I\u2019ll walk through each step with you.  \n* **Ask for a hint** \u2013 I can remind you of the \u201cpercent \u2192 decimal \u2192 multiply\u201d recipe or give you a \u201c10\u202f% + 10\u202f% + 3\u202f%\u201d shortcut.\n\nTake your time, and remember: **convert \u2192 multiply once \u2192 stop**. Once you have an answer, tell me how you got it, and we\u2019ll check it together. Good luck!",
