    "content": "Based on the student's recent performance and learning events, I'd like to create a practice question that builds upon their recent success with discount and addresses their areas of difficulty.\n\nHere's a question to get started:\n\n**Practice Question 1:**\n\n\"Sarah is buying a new pair of shoes on sale. The original price of the shoes is $80. If the store is offering a 15% discount, how much will Sarah pay for the shoes after the discount?\"\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n1. It's a straightforward discount problem, building on the student's recent success with a similar concept.\n2. The discount percentage is not too high or too low, allowing the student to practice calculating a moderate discount.\n3. The original price is a simple, round number, making it easier for the student to focus on the calculation rather than getting bogged down by complex numbers.\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n* The student's ability to calculate the discount amount (15% of $80).\n* The student's ability to subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price.\n\nLet's see how the student does!",

    "content": "**Student's Last Answer Explanation:**\n\nThe student attempted to solve the problem by calculating 15% of $80, which is a good start. However, the student made a slight error in the calculation. To find 15% of $80, the student should multiply 80 by 0.15 (since 15% is equal to 0.15 as a decimal). \n\n80 * 0.15 = $12\n\nThe correct discount amount is $12, not $10. To find the final price, the student should subtract the discount from the original price: $80 - $12 = $68. Therefore, the correct answer is $68, not $70.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's difficulty with exponents, I'd like to introduce a new concept that builds upon their recent success with discount. Here's a question to help the student practice both discount and exponents:\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\n\"A store is offering a discount of 20% on all items.

This question combines the student's recent success with discount and introduces a new concept: applying multiple discounts.\n2. The student will need to calculate two discounts: 20% and 10%.\n3. The original price is a simple, round number, making it easier for the student to focus on the calculations.\n\n**What I'm looking for:**\n\n* The student's ability to calculate the first discount (20% of $120).\n* The student's ability to calculate the second discount (10% of the price after the first discount).\n* The student's ability to apply both discounts to find the final price.\n\nThis question will help the student practice calculating multiple discounts and apply their knowledge of exponents (in the form of percentages) to a more complex scenario.",

To find 20% of $120, the student should multiply 120 by 0.20 (since 20% is equal to 0.20 as a decimal).\n\n120 * 0.20 = $24\n\nThe correct discount amount is $24, not $20. To find the price after the first discount, the student should subtract the discount from the original price: $120 - $24 = $96.\n\nThe student then attempted to calculate the second discount (10% of $100), which is a good start. To find 10% of $100, the student should multiply 100 by 0.10 (since 10% is equal to 0.10 as a decimal).\n\n100 * 0.10 = $10\n\nHowever, the student subtracted this amount from the original price ($100), not the price after the first discount ($96). To find the final price, the student should subtract the second discount from the price after the first discount: $96 - $10 = $86. Therefore, the correct answer is $86, not $90.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's difficulty with interpreting linear equations, I'd like to introduce a new concept that builds upon their recent success with discount and introduces a new concept: linear equations.

This question combines the student's recent success with discount and introduces a new concept: linear equations.\n2. The student will need to apply the discount to a linear equation, which requires them to understand the concept of variables and how they relate to the equation.\n3.

The student wrote the equation as \\(\\sqrt{13^{2}-5^{2}}=\\sqrt{144-25}=\\sqrt{119}\\). However, the student did not simplify the square root of 119, which can be simplified to \\(\\sqrt{119}\\) as it doesn't simplify further into a whole number and an integer. \n\n**Next Question:**\n\n\"A right triangle has a base of 8 inches and a height of 15 inches. If the length of the hypotenuse is 17 inches, find the length of the other leg of the triangle (either the base or the height).",
