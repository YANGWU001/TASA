A percentage is a way to show a part of a whole. In this case, we're looking for what part of 20 is equal to 4. Let's try to think about it like this: if you have 20 cookies and you eat 4 of them, what fraction of the cookies have you eaten? You can represent this as a fraction: 4/20. Now, let's convert the fraction to a percentage by dividing the numerator (4) by the denominator (20) and multiplying by 100. \n\nDo you want to try solving it on your own or would you like a step-by-step solution?",

    "content": "**Student's Last Answer:**\nYou've tried to solve the problem by dividing 4 by 20 and then multiplying by 100, which is a good start. However, the issue is that you're multiplying 0.2 (the result of 4 divided by 20) by 100, which is actually 20%, not 25%. So, your final answer is actually correct, but for a different reason than you thought. The correct thought process would be: 4/20 = 0.2, then 0.2 * 100 = 20%. But since the question asks for the percentage of 20 that is 4, and 4 is half of 20, the correct answer is indeed 50% of 20, which is the same as saying half of 20, so the correct answer is B) 20% or half of 20.",
