    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student attempted to solve the combinatorics problem by breaking it down into smaller parts. They correctly identified the need to place one book on each shelf first, leaving 7 books remaining. They then considered the restriction of \"at most 2 more books per shelf\" and tried to count the ways to distribute these 7 books among the 5 shelves. However, their approach to counting the ways to distribute the extra books was not clearly explained and was based on a guess. They then multiplied this number by the permutations of the books on each shelf, resulting in an answer of 1260.\n\nWhile the student showed some understanding of the concept of arranging objects with restrictions, their approach to solving the problem was not entirely clear and relied on a guess. Therefore, they did not fully apply the correct method for solving the problem.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nBased on the student's struggle with the previous question and their need for improvement in combinatorics, I would recommend a practice question that builds on their existing knowledge and focuses on a more basic concept.

They correctly applied the permutation formula, 6!, to calculate the total number of arrangements without restrictions. However, they introduced confusion by initially considering the block method and then correctly applying it to arrive at the answer. The student's final answer of **B) 480** is correct.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nBased on the student's struggle with the previous question and their need for improvement in combinatorics, I would recommend a practice question that builds on their existing knowledge and focuses on a more basic concept.

The student will need to use the formula for probability to calculate the chance of drawing 2 blue balls. This question is a good starting point because it's a relatively simple problem that still requires some thought and calculation.\n\n**Why this question?**\n\nThis question is a good choice because it:\n\n1.  Builds on the student's existing knowledge of probability.\n2.  Requires the student to apply a formula to calculate the probability.\n3.
