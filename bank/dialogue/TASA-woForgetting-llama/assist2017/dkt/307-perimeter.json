It requires the student to apply their knowledge: The student needs to use the concept of probability and the total number of marbles in the bag to solve the problem.\n3. It's a gradual increase in difficulty: The question involves a basic concept with a related formula, which is a good stepping stone for the student to build upon their current skills.\n\n**Hint:** You can encourage the student to use the formula for probability and subtract the probability of drawing a red marble from 1 to find the probability of drawing a non-red marble.",
