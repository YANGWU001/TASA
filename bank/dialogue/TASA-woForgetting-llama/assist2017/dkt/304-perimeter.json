They correctly identified that the path's width would be added to each side of the garden, resulting in new dimensions of 12 meters (8 + 2 + 2) for the length and 9 meters (5 + 2 + 2) for the width. However, they then incorrectly multiplied the sum of the new dimensions (12 + 9 = 21) by 2, which would give the perimeter if the path was only on one side. Since the path is around the entire garden, it's added to all four sides, not just two. To find the correct perimeter, we should multiply the sum of the new dimensions by 2 and then add the width of the path to that result, but since the path is around the garden, it's already included in the calculation.

They correctly identified the new dimensions of the garden with the path, 12 meters by 9 meters, and attempted to calculate the new perimeter. However, they are still struggling with the correct formula for finding the perimeter of a shape with an added feature, such as the path in this case. They are trying to account for the path's width being added to all four sides, which is correct, but their proposed solutions, 2 \u00d7 (12 + 9) + 2 = 44 m or 2 \u00d7 (12 + 9) + 4 = 46 m, are not accurate. The correct approach is to multiply the sum of the new dimensions by 2, which gives the perimeter of the garden with the path on the inside, and then add the width of the path to that result to account for the path on the outside. However, since the path is around the entire garden, it's already included in the calculation when we multiply the sum of the new dimensions by 2.

The correct calculation for the perimeter is 2(l + w) = 2(8 + 5) = 2(13) = 26 cm for the top and bottom, and 2(l + w) = 2(8 + 10) = 2(18) = 36 cm for the sides. The total perimeter is the sum of these two values: 26 cm + 36 cm = 62 cm.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question 7:**\n\nA bookshelf has 5 shelves, each with 8 books on it. If the books are packed tightly, with no gaps between them, what is the total number of books on the bookshelf?\n\nThis question:\n\n* Involves the concept of multiplication, which the student has shown understanding of\n* Allows the student to practice their arithmetic skills, specifically multiplication\n* Is a straightforward problem that will help the student build confidence in their math skills\n\nTo help the student, I'll provide a hint: The total number of books is the product of the number of shelves and the number of books on each shelf.\n\nStudent, can you start by finding the total number of books on the bookshelf?",
