The correct simplification of 12/24 is indeed 1/2, not 2/3.\n\nThe student's answer for the percent question is correct.

For example, we can ask the student to convert different percents to decimals and vice versa, and provide real-world scenarios where they can apply this skill.\n\nWe can also review the concept of equivalent ratios and proportions to help the student better understand how percents and decimals relate to each other.
