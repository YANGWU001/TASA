The student needs to remember that the bar is just a shaded part of one of the existing 12 parts and not an additional division.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo further reinforce the student's understanding and build on their skills, let's try a question that targets the concept of identifying equal divisions (horizontal bar) with a focus on accurately counting the total number of parts, including both shaded and unshaded sections. Here's a new question:\n\n**Practice Question 10:**\n\nImagine a picture of a chart divided into 8 equal parts, with a horizontal bar covering 5 of these parts, as shown below. Can you count the number of equal parts that the chart is divided into?\n\n[Visual aid: A simple drawing of a chart divided into 8 equal parts, with each part clearly numbered from 1 to 8, and a horizontal bar covering parts 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6]\n\nA) 6 parts\nB) 7 parts\nC) 8 parts\nD) 9 parts\nE) 10 parts\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n- This question targets the concept of identifying the number of equal divisions (horizontal bar) with a focus on accurately counting the total number of parts, including both shaded and unshaded sections.\n- The visual aid helps the student to visualize the concept and make the question more engaging.\n- The question is still within the student's zone of proximal development, allowing them to build on their previous knowledge and skills.\n- The clear numbering and horizontal bar will help the student to count the parts more accurately.\n\n**Learning objective:**\n\n- Identify the number of equal divisions (horizontal bar) in a given visual representation with increased accuracy.\n- Develop confidence in counting equal parts of a divided shape with a horizontal bar.",
