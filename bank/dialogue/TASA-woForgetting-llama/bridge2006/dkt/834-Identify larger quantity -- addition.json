Which group has more blocks?\n\nGroup A: 5 blocks\nGroup B: 8 blocks\n\n**Visual Aid:** (A simple drawing of two groups of blocks, one with 5 blocks and the other with 8 blocks)\n\n**Question:** Which group has more blocks?\n\n**Explanation:** This question targets the student's ability to compare two quantities and identify the larger one. The student will need to use their understanding of basic addition concepts to determine which group has more blocks.\n\n**Note:** I will provide feedback and guidance after the student's response to help them improve their accuracy and understanding of the concept.",
