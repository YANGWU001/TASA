As per the given options, the correct answer is not B) 8. Let's break down the problem together.\n\nTo find the difference between 17 and 9, we need to subtract 9 from 17. This can be visualized on a number line by starting at 17 and moving 9 units to the left. The resulting position will be 8 units to the left of 17, which means the difference is 8 units.\n\n**Correct answer:** The correct difference between 17 and 9 is actually 8 units to the left, which is equivalent to 8.
