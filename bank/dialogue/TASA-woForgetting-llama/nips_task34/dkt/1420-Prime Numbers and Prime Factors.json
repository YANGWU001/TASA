Here's the first practice question:\n\n**Question:** Identify the prime factors of 36.\n\n**Instructions:** A prime factor is a prime number that can be multiplied together to give the original number. For example, the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 2 and 3 (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 12). Write down all the prime factors of 36.\n\n**A)** 2, 2, 3\n**B)** 2, 3, 5\n**C)** 2, 2, 2, 3\n**D)** 3, 3, 3, 2\n\n**Hint:** Think about the multiplication of the numbers that can result in 36.\n\nThis question is designed to help the student understand the concept of prime factors, and it's a relatively simple question to start with. It also requires the student to think critically and apply their knowledge of multiplication to find the correct answer.",
