    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student attempted to determine whether 15 is a prime number but initially expressed a belief that it is prime. They provided a correct understanding of the definition of a prime number, stating that a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. However, they incorrectly applied this definition to the number 15. The number 15 has more than two distinct positive divisors: 1, 3, 5, and 15. Therefore, 15 is not a prime number.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Practice Question 10: Multiplying and Dividing Negative Numbers**\n\nSolve the following problem: (-3) \u00d7 (-2)\n\n**Hint:** When multiplying two negative numbers, the product is always positive.\n\nThis question builds upon the student's existing knowledge of multiplying and dividing negative numbers by:\n\n1.  Increasing the difficulty level by asking the student to apply the concept to a specific problem.\n2.  Encouraging the student to apply the concept to a more complex scenario.\n\n**Learning objectives:**\n\n* Understand the rule for multiplying two negative numbers.\n* Apply the rule to solve a problem involving multiplying two negative numbers.\n* Develop problem-solving skills by applying the concept to a more complex scenario.\n\nThis question will help the student to:\n\n* Practice multiplying negative numbers.\n* Develop their problem-solving skills by applying the concept to a more complex scenario.\n* Build confidence in their understanding of multiplying and dividing negative numbers.\n\nThis question is tailored to the student's knowledge state, as they have shown a need for improvement in multiplying and dividing negative numbers. By practicing solving a problem involving multiplying two negative numbers, the student will build upon their existing knowledge and develop their problem-solving skills.",
