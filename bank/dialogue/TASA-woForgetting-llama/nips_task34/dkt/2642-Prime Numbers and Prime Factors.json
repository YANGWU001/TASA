They correctly identified the number 2 as a prime number, but incorrectly included 9 as a prime factor. However, 9 is not a prime number (it can be divided by 3), which means it is not a prime factor of 36. To determine the prime factors of 36, we need to find all the prime numbers that divide 36 exactly without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Prime Factors of 36:**\nTo find the prime factors of 36, let's list the numbers that divide 36 exactly without leaving a remainder:\n- 1 and 36\n- 2 and 18\n- 3 and 12\n- 4 and 9\n- 6 and 6\nThe prime numbers among these pairs are 2 and 3. Therefore, the prime factors of 36 are 2 and 3.\n\n**Next Question:**\nTo build upon the student's understanding of prime factors, let's try a question that requires them to apply this knowledge to a slightly more complex scenario.\n\n**Question:** \nA bookshelf has 48 books on it. If we want to arrange the books in pairs, how many different ways can we do this, if each pair must have the same number of books and the prime factors of the number of books in each pair must be 2 and 3?\n\n**Hint:** Think about the prime factors of 48 and how they can be combined to form pairs of books.",

However, their explanation was incomplete and lacked clarity.\n\nTo address this, let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nThe prime factorization of 144 is \\(2^4 \\times 3^2\\). The possible combinations of prime factors that can form boxes of loaves that meet the given conditions are:\n\n*   12 loaves: \\(2^2 \\times 3\\)\n*   18 loaves: \\(2 \\times 3^2\\)\n*   24 loaves: \\(2^3 \\times 3\\)\n\nHowever, to find the number of ways these combinations can be formed using the prime factors of 144, we need to consider the different ways to combine the prime factors 2 and 3 to get the required number of loaves.\n\nLet's analyze each combination separately:\n\n*   For 12 loaves, we have \\(2^2 \\times 3\\), which can be formed by combining two 2's and one 3.\n*   For 18 loaves, we have \\(2 \\times 3^2\\), which can be formed by combining one 2 and two 3's.\n*   For 24 loaves, we have \\(2^3 \\times 3\\), which can be formed by combining three 2's and one 3.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways these combinations can be formed using the prime factors of 144:\n\n*   For 12 loaves, we can choose 2's in 4 different ways (0, 1, 2, or 3) and 3's in 2 different ways (0 or 1). Therefore, there are 4 x 2 = 8 ways to form 12 loaves.\n*   For 18 loaves, we can choose 2's in 4 different ways (0, 1, 2, or 3) and 3's in 3 different ways (0, 1, or 2). However, we need to exclude the case where we choose 0 2's and 0 3's, which is not possible. Therefore, there are 4 x 3 - 1 = 11 ways to form 18 loaves.\n*   For 24 loaves, we can choose 2's in 4 different ways (0, 1, 2, or 3) and 3's in 2 different ways (0 or 1). However, we need to exclude the case where we choose 0 2's and 0 3's, which is not possible. Therefore, there are 4 x 2 - 1 = 7 ways to form 24 loaves.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways the bakery can package loaves of bread in boxes of 12, 18, or 24 is 8 + 11 + 7 = 26.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help the student build upon their understanding of prime factors and their application to a more complex scenario, let's try a question that requires them to think critically about the relationships between numbers and their prime factors.\n\n**Question 1: Gradient Between Two Co-ordinates**\n\nFind the gradient between the co-ordinates (2, 3) and (4, 5).\n\nTo find the gradient between two co-ordinates, we can use the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gradient} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\]\n\nwhere (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the two co-ordinates.\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gradient} = \\frac{5 - 3}{4 - 2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, the gradient between the co-ordinates (2, 3) and (4, 5) is 1.\n\n**Question 2: Translation and Vectors**\n\nA vector is given by the equation (2x + 3, 4x - 2).

At 3:45, the minute hand is at the 9-o'clock position, which is directly opposite the 3-o'clock position. Therefore, the angle between the two hands is 180\u00b0.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's understanding of basic angle facts and their ability to apply them to a more complex scenario, let's try a question that requires them to think critically about the relationships between numbers and their prime factors.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA baker is making a cake that requires 2x^2 + 5x + 6 groups of ingredients. The baker already has 2x + 3 groups of ingredients. How many more groups of ingredients does the baker need to buy?\n\nTo solve this problem, the student will need to factorize the expression 2x^2 + 5x + 6 and use their understanding of prime factors to find the solution.",
