Maybe I should have done the \u201c\u2011 (\u20112)\u201d as just adding 2, which I think I did. If I maybe made a mistake with the last part, it could end up being something like\u202f\u20111 instead of\u202f\u20113.\n\nSo, I\u2019m guessing the answer is **\u20111**\u2026 I think?  (I\u2019m not completely confident.)"

    "content": "**Explanation of Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's last answer is **-3**, but they had some doubts and uncertainty about the correct solution. They correctly transformed the expression by removing the brackets and handling the negative numbers, but they struggled with the order of operations and the correct handling of the signs. They provided a step-by-step solution, but their confidence in the answer is low due to concerns about the signs and the order of operations.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo address the student's struggle with adding and subtracting negative numbers and the order of operations, let's try a question that focuses on these concepts:\n\n**Question:** -5 + 2 + (-3) - 1\n\n**Instructions:** Apply BIDMAS to solve the expression and handle the negative numbers carefully.\n\n**Hint:** Remember to follow the order of operations and perform the operations within the brackets first. Also, think about the concept of adding and subtracting negative numbers as mentioned earlier: subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding a positive number.\n\nTake your time, and when you're ready, let me know your answer!\n\n**Additional Guidance:**\n\nTo help you better understand the concept of adding and subtracting negative numbers, let's break down the expression into simpler parts. We can rewrite -5 + 2 as (-5) + 2, since adding a positive number to a negative number is equivalent to adding a negative number to a negative number. Now, the expression becomes (-5) + 2 + (-3) - 1. Can you try to solve it step by step?",
