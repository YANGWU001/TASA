However, to verify the accuracy of this answer, let's break down the given time: 3 hours and 45 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours would be 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. Adding 45 minutes to that, we get 180 + 45 = 225 minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is **A) 225 minutes**. The student's answer of 240 minutes is 15 minutes more than the actual time, which is a common mistake in time conversions.\n\n**Next Question:**\nGiven that the student struggled with time conversions and needs improvement in mental multiplication and division, the next question will combine both concepts to reinforce their learning.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\n**Time and Multiplication**\n\nA school bus travels at a speed of 45 kilometers per hour.
