They correctly multiplied 6 and 9 to get 54, but then they were unsure about the division step. To calculate 54 \u00f7 3, the student can use their knowledge of division facts or mental math strategies. A simple approach is to think of 54 as 50 + 4, and then divide 50 by 3 (which is 16 with a remainder of 2) and add the remainder to the result of 4 \u00f7 3 (which is 1 with a remainder of 1). Therefore, 54 \u00f7 3 is 18 with a remainder of 0, but in this case, the remainder is not relevant to the question.
