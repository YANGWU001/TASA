    "content": "Based on the student's areas of need, recent learning events, and request, I've generated a first practice question to help them learn about writing expressions with a negative slope.\n\n**Question:** Write an expression for the line that passes through the points (2, 3) and (-3, -2).\n\n**Hint:** The slope of the line can be calculated using the formula: \n\nm = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nwhere (x1, y1) = (2, 3) and (x2, y2) = (-3, -2)\n\n**Additional Help:**\n\n* Remember to use a negative slope when the line is going down from left to right.\n* Use the slope formula to find the slope of the line.\n* Write the equation in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\n**Learning Goal:** Write an expression for a line with a negative slope.\n\nThis question will help the student practice writing expressions with a negative slope by applying the slope formula and using a given set of points. The hint and additional help provided will guide the student in the right direction, while the question itself is challenging but not too difficult.",
