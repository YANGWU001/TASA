A dozen is a unit of measurement equal to 12, but it is not the unit of measurement for the number 25. The number 25 does not have a unit of measurement in the context provided, as it appears to be an integer value without any specified unit.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nConsidering the student's need for improvement in Identifying units, let's try a new question that requires them to apply their understanding of units to a more complex scenario.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\nA bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 5 books.
