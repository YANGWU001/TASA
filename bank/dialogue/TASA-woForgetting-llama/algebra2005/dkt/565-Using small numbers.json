However, the student's reasoning was somewhat uncertain, and they relied on a rough estimate rather than a precise calculation. They correctly identified that 6 goes into 24 about three times, but their confidence in the answer was wavering. The student's answer, \\(x = 3\\), is actually correct, as 6 * 3 = 18, which is close to the original equation, but they should have been more confident in their calculation.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Practice Question 10:**\n\nSolve for x: 4x = 16\n\n**Reasoning Skill:** Using small numbers\n\n**Explanation:** This question is similar to the previous ones, but with a different coefficient (4) and a multiple of 4. The student needs to apply the concept of 'Using small numbers' to isolate the variable x by dividing both sides of the equation by 4. This question will help the student reinforce their understanding of division facts with small numbers. To support the student's learning, let's try to use visual aids or real-life examples to help them understand the concept of division with small numbers, such as using blocks or counting bears to demonstrate how to divide numbers like 16 by 4.",
