Here's the question:\n\n**Question:** \n\nA water tank can hold 450,000 liters of water. If 237,000 liters of water are already in the tank, how many more liters of water can be added to the tank?\n\n**Reasoning Skill:** This question requires the student to perform a subtraction operation with large numbers, which is a key concept in 'Using large numbers.' The student will need to subtract 237,000 from 450,000 to find the remaining capacity of the tank. This will help the student practice their ability to work with large numbers and develop their understanding of this concept.\n\n**Difficulty Level:** Medium\n\n**Estimated Time:** 3-5 minutes\n\nThis question is designed to be challenging but manageable for the student, allowing them to apply their understanding of large numbers in a real-world context.",
