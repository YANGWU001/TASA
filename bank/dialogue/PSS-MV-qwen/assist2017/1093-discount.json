Since you're a student who needs personalized guidance, I\u2019ll start with a question that invites reflection and helps you connect the concept of discount to something you already understand\u2014like real-life situations or personal experiences.\n\n**First question:**  \n*Can you think of a time when you've seen a discount in a store, online, or in a sale? What did you notice about the original price and the final price? How did you figure out how much you saved?*\n\nThis question encourages you to recall personal experiences, think critically, and begin to explore the idea of discount in a meaningful, relatable way\u2014just how personalized tutoring works! \ud83d\ude0a  \nWhat do you think?",

Think about a time when you saw a price drop or a sale. Maybe it was a toy, a movie ticket, or a lunch deal.  \n\nWhat\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve seen or experienced where something was cheaper than usual? Even if it\u2019s just a thought \u2014 that\u2019s a great start.  \n\n**Next question (matches learning preferences):**  \nCan you think of a real-life example \u2014 like a store, a game, or a class \u2014 where something was sold at a lower price than usual? What was the original price, and what was the discounted price?  \n\nThis gives you a safe, personal entry point and helps you build the concept step by step, without pressure.
