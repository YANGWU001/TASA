What did you notice about the edges or boundaries there?*\n\nThis question helps you connect the concept to personal experience, making it more meaningful and easier to understand. It also opens the door for you to share what you already know or see, so we can build from there. Ready to share? \ud83d\ude0a",

You noticed the room is a rectangle, and you're thinking about the four walls as the \"edges\" you walk around.

That\u2019s a great start! Now, if you can estimate the width (maybe how wide the room is from wall to wall), we can actually *calculate* the perimeter together. And since you're someone who learns best by connecting ideas to your world, I\u2019d love to see how you\u2019d figure it out\u2014maybe even by drawing a quick sketch or imagining your cleaning path. Let\u2019s keep building on this real-life example.\n\n---\n\n**2) Next question that matches their preferences:**\n\nCan you estimate the width of your bedroom (from wall to wall), and then use that to figure out the total distance you\u2019d walk if you went all the way around the room\u2014just like when you\u2019re cleaning?  \n(You can say \u201cI think it\u2019s about 2.5 meters\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe 3 meters too?\u201d\u2014no need to be perfect.
