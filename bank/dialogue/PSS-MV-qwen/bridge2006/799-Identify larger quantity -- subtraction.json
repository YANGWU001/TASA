Since you're a student who needs personalized guidance, I\u2019ll start with a question that\u2019s clear, relatable, and invites you to think through the concept step by step\u2014just like we\u2019d walk through it together.\n\n**First Question:**  \n\"Imagine you have 15 apples and you give away 7 of them to a friend. How many apples do you have left? Now, think about it this way: what does the subtraction (15 \u2212 7) tell you about the *larger* quantity you started with? Can you explain in your own words how subtraction helps you find the difference between the two amounts?\"\n\nThis question builds on real-life context, encourages self-explanation, and gently introduces the idea of identifying the larger quantity before subtracting. It also invites you to reflect and connect the math to your own thinking\u2014perfect for a student who benefits from personalized, thoughtful guidance.  \n\nHow does that feel? Ready to answer or would you like to adjust it? \ud83d\ude0a",

Instead, let\u2019s *build* your understanding together \u2014 step by step, in a way that feels safe and familiar.  \n\nThink of it like this: Imagine you have 7 apples, and you eat 3. How many do you have left? That\u2019s subtraction \u2014 and it\u2019s all about finding the *difference* between two amounts.
