How many apples do you have now? Can you show me how you figured it out using something you see or touch?\"**\n\nThis question:  \n\u2705 Uses a real-life scenario (apples) to make addition tangible  \n\u2705 Encourages you to think through the process step-by-step  \n\u2705 Invites you to explain your thinking \u2014 helping you build confidence  \n\u2705 Gives you space to respond in your own way (verbal, drawing, or even counting out objects)\n\nTake your time with this.

The next step is to add more apples \u2014 maybe some green ones \u2014 so you can see how the total grows. This helps you *see* the larger quantity, not just count it.  \n\nYou said: *\"First I counted the red ones: 3 apples.\"* That\u2019s a strong start!
