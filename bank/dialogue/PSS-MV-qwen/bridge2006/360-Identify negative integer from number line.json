Since you're a student who needs personalized guidance, let's start with a question that invites reflection and active thinking \u2014 something that helps you *see* and *feel* the concept rather than just memorize it.\n\n**First question:**  \n\"Imagine you're standing on zero on a number line. If you take one step to the left, where do you end up? Now, what does that position represent \u2014 a positive or negative number? Why do you think that direction (left) is linked to negative numbers?\"\n\nThis question is designed to help you connect the physical movement on the number line to the concept of negative integers, making it more intuitive and personal.

Learning about negative integers on a number line doesn\u2019t just happen in your head; it shows up when you *see* it, *feel* it, and *move* through it. Since you're a student who needs personalized guidance, let\u2019s not jump to rules or definitions right away. Instead, let\u2019s *imagine* standing on a number line and taking a step \u2014 one step left, one step right. How does that feel? What happens to your position when you go left? That\u2019s where negative numbers live \u2014 not in a book, but in the space *before* zero, where we start moving backward.  \n\nYou don\u2019t need to know the answer yet \u2014 just *experience* it. That\u2019s how understanding grows.\n\n---\n\n**Next Question (matching learning preferences):**  \nImagine you're standing at zero on a number line. Now, take one step to the left. Where do you land? What number does that point represent?  \n\n(Answer in words \u2014 like \"I land at -1\" \u2014 not just \"negative one\" \u2014 because *feeling* the movement helps you remember it.)  \n\nThis small step lets you *see* the pattern and build confidence \u2014 one step at a time.

You're not just guessing \u2014 you're *experiencing* the concept. That\u2019s powerful. Now, what if we go one more step left from -1? Where do you think you'd land?
