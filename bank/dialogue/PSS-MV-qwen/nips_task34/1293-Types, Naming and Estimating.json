That\u2019s exactly the kind of *real-world experience* that makes abstract concepts like *data types* come alive. You didn\u2019t just memorize it \u2014 you *lived* it. And that\u2019s powerful. When a cell has text like \u201cTotal\u201d instead of a number, the system doesn\u2019t know how to add it. It treats everything as a *string*, so instead of doing math, it just joins the text. That\u2019s a perfect example of how **types matter** \u2014 they\u2019re like rules that tell computers what to do with data.  \n\nYou\u2019re already thinking like a programmer!

(And if you want, you can even imagine the friend being confused by a \u201cTotal\u201d label in a column of numbers \u2014 just like you were!)*  \n\nThis helps you **connect the concept to communication and clarity**, which strengthens your understanding and gives you a way to explain it to others \u2014 a key skill in learning.\n\n---\n\nThis approach keeps the student engaged by:  \n\u2705 Drawing from their own experience  \n\u2705 Encouraging reflection and explanation  \n\u2705 Making the abstract concrete through real-life scenarios  \n\u2705 Building confidence through personal success  \n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready to go deeper \u2014 or if you\u2019d like to explore naming conventions or estimating next! \ud83d\ude0a",
