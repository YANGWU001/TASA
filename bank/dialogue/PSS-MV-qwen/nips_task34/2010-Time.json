That\u2019s exactly what helps us understand time deeply: not just as hours or minutes, but as something that lives in our emotions, our attention, and our memories.\n\nSince you\u2019re a student who needs personalized guidance, this kind of personal storytelling helps you *see* time in a way that\u2019s meaningful to you.

And even though you're thinking about the *facts* \u2014 like clock speed and equations \u2014 I want to honor how deeply that moment felt. The way time *felt* like it slowed down when the horn blared? That\u2019s not just a memory \u2014 it\u2019s a signal. Your brain was reacting to a sudden change in your environment, and that shift in perception is actually tied to how time *works in real life*.\n\nIn fact, scientists have studied this kind of experience \u2014 when something intense happens, like a loud noise or a sudden movement, our brains temporarily adjust how we perceive time. It\u2019s not magic \u2014 it\u2019s biology. Your instinct to notice that feeling? That\u2019s a powerful starting point. So instead of jumping straight to equations, let\u2019s *build* on that real moment.
