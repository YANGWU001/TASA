Think about how you can make the denominator close to 100.\n\n(Remember, you can multiply both numbers by the same number to make the denominator close to 100, or find a multiple of 32 that is close to 100.)\n\nOkay, I think I can try multiplying 32 by 3 to get 96, so 13 \u00d7 3 = 39 and 32 \u00d7 3 = 96.\n\nSo, 13\u204432 becomes 39\u204496, which is equivalent to 13\u204432. To convert this to a percent, I can read the top number as the percent, which is 40.625%.\n\nIs that right?\n\nYou're getting close, but the correct answer is 40.625%. To get that, you can use a calculator or do the division by hand.\n\n13 \u00f7 32 = 0.40625\n\nThen, multiply by 100:\n\n0.40625 \u00d7 100 = 40.625%\n\nYou're doing great, and you're close!

Scale the fraction so the denominator becomes 100 (or something close to 100) and then read the new numerator as the percent.\n\nBoth methods will give you the same answer, and the \"scale-to-100\" trick is handy when the denominator has a nice factor that makes 100 easy to reach.\n\nNow, let's check your answer for 23\u204445 using the \"scale-to-100\" method.
