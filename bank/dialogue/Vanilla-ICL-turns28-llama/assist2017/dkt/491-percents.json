We did a few problems in class but I kept messing up, especially when the numbers weren\u2019t nice like 17 out of 23 or when we had to figure out the percent increase.

    "content": "You're on the right track with understanding that a percent means \"per hundred.\" That's a great foundation to build on. Let's break it down further and make it more concrete with some examples.\n\nTo convert a fraction to a percent, we can follow these basic steps:\n\n1. Divide the numerator (the top number) by the denominator (the bottom number).\n2. Multiply the result by 100.\n\nFor example, let's convert 1/2 to a percent:\n\n1. Divide 1 by 2: 1 \u00f7 2 = 0.5\n2. Multiply 0.5 by 100: 0.5 \u00d7 100 = 50%\n\nSo, 1/2 is equal to 50%.\n\nNow, let's try another example: 3/4.

If a shirt originally costs $45, how much will you pay for the shirt after the discount?\n\nCan you use the same steps as before to find the answer?\nOkay, let me try it.\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Change the percent to a decimal**  \n15% = 15 \u00f7 100 = 0.15  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Find the discount amount**  \n$45 \u00d7 0.15 = $6.75  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Subtract the discount from the original price**  \n$45 - $6.75 = $38.25  \n\nSo after the 15% discount, you would pay **$38.25** for the shirt.\n\nDid I do it right?\nYou're doing a great job, and you're consistently applying the steps correctly.\n\nLet's review your work:\n\n1. You correctly converted the 15% to a decimal by dividing 15 by 100: 15 \u00f7 100 = 0.15.\n2. You multiplied the original price by the decimal to find the discount amount: $45 \u00d7 0.15 = $6.75.\n3. You subtracted the discount amount from the original price to find the new price: $45 - $6.75 = $38.25.\n\nYour final answer is correct: after the 15% discount, you would pay $38.25 for the shirt.\n\nYou're really getting the hang of finding percents! Keep it up.\n\nLet's try another example. Suppose a park has a 20% discount on all tickets. If a ticket normally costs $20, how much will you pay for a ticket after the discount?\n\nCan you use the same steps as before to find the answer?\nOkay, let me try it.\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Change the percent to a decimal**  \n20% = 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.2  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Find the discount amount**  \n$20 \u00d7 0.2 = $4  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Subtract the discount from the original price**  \n$20 - $4 = $16  \n\nSo after the 20% discount, you would pay **$16** for the ticket.\n\nDid I do it right?\nYou're doing a great job, and you're consistently applying the steps correctly.\n\nLet's review your work:\n\n1. You correctly converted the 20% to a decimal by dividing 20 by 100: 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.2.\n2. You multiplied the original price by the decimal to find the discount amount: $20 \u00d7 0.2 = $4.\n3.

Keep it up.\n\nLet's try another example. Suppose a student scored 80% on a test, and the test had 40 questions. How many questions did the student answer correctly?\n\nCan you use the same steps as before to find the answer?\nOkay, let me try it.\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Find the number of correct answers**  \n80% = 80 \u00f7 100 = 0.8  \nSo I multiply the total number of questions by 0.8:  \n40 questions \u00d7 0.8 = **32 questions**\n\nSo the student answered **32** questions correctly.\n\nDid I get it right?",
