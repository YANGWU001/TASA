The top number (numerator) tells you how many parts you have, and the bottom number (denominator) tells you how many parts make a whole.\n\nYour understanding of adding fractions with the same denominator is correct: \\( \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{3}{5} \\). When the denominators are different, finding a common denominator can be a bit tricky, but we can work through it.\n\nNow, let's dive into multiplying fractions. Multiplying fractions is actually quite similar to adding them, but we don't need to worry about finding a common denominator. To multiply fractions, we simply multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.\n\nLet's try a simple example: \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\).

What happens when we multiply a fraction by a whole number? For example, what is \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 2 \\)?

Then, you simplified the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, which resulted in \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nTo confirm, let's check our work by multiplying \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times 2 = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\nYour answer matches exactly!\n\nLet's try another example. What if we multiply a fraction by a fraction, but the second fraction has a numerator of 0? For example, what is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{0}{5} \\)? Think about what happens when you multiply 0 by any number.\n\n(Remember, multiplying by 0 makes the product 0.)\nOh, okay... I think I can see what you're getting at. If I multiply 0 by any number, the product is always 0.

Think about what happens when you multiply negative numbers.\n\n(Remember, multiplying negative numbers gives you a positive product, but you need to be careful with the signs when multiplying fractions.)\nOkay, I think I know this one. When I multiply negative numbers, the product is positive. But I need to be careful with the signs. So, I multiply the numerators together and the denominators together, and then I have to remember that the product is positive.\n\nSo, multiplying the numerators gives me -8 (2 x -4 = -8) and multiplying the denominators gives me 15 (3 x 5 = 15). Since the product of negative numbers is positive, the answer is \\(\\frac{8}{15}\\).\n\nThat's almost correct! You correctly multiplied the numerators and denominators together, but you forgot to keep the negative sign in the numerator. The correct answer is indeed \\(-\\frac{8}{15}\\).
