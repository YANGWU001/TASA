The correct answer is actually 8, which is the smallest number that appears in both lists of multiples. You can see that 8 is a multiple of 4 (4 x 2 = 8) and 8 is also a multiple of 8 (8 x 1 = 8).\n\nIt's great that you're trying to find the common multiple by listing multiples of both numbers. Remember, the smallest number that appears in both lists is the least common multiple (LCM). In this case, the LCM of 8 and 4 is 8.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\nLet's try another one.

However, I notice that you got stuck when trying to identify the smallest common multiple. \n\nLet's break it down. You correctly listed the multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, ... and the multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, ... As you can see, the smallest number that appears in both lists is 8, not 12. This is because 8 is a multiple of both 8 and 4. \n\nLet's review the concept of the least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. In this case, since 8 is a multiple of both 8 and 4, it's the LCM.\n\n**Practice Question 1**\n\nLet's try another question to practice identifying the LCM.

You're on the right track by listing multiples of both numbers, but it seems like you're not entirely confident in your answer.\n\nLet's break it down together. You said that 15 is a multiple of 15, which is true, but it's also true that 15 is not a multiple of 8. So, it can't be the smallest number that's a multiple of both 15 and 8. You also mentioned that 15 might be a multiple of 6, but that's not entirely correct either.\n\nA multiple of 6 is a number that can be divided by 6 without leaving a remainder. 15 can be divided by 5, not 6. To find the smallest number that's a multiple of both 15 and 6, we need to find the smallest number that both numbers can divide into evenly.\n\nLet's try to find the multiples of both 15 and 6 together, and see if we can identify the smallest number that meets this condition.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nFind the smallest number that's a multiple of both 12 and 18.\n\nPlease list the multiples of both numbers and try to find the smallest number that's a multiple of both 12 and 18.",

Let's review what we've learned before. We discussed the concept of the Greatest Common Factor (GCF), which is related to the Least Common Multiple (LCM). Remember that the GCF is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder, whereas the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers.\n\nIn this case, we're looking for the LCM of 15 and 6. To find the LCM, we can list the multiples of both numbers, but let's think of it in a more efficient way. We can use the fact that the LCM is related to the product of the two numbers. However, this is not the case here as it's not the best method for this problem.\n\nLet's go back to listing multiples of both numbers. Multiples of 15 are: 15, 30, 45, 60... Multiples of 6 are: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30...\n\nAs we can see, the smallest number that appears in both lists is 30. Therefore, the LCM of 15 and 6 is 30.

As you can see, 36 is the smallest number that appears in both lists.\n\nDon't worry, it's okay to make mistakes! We can work through this together.

You've had some trouble identifying common factors in our previous attempts, which is a crucial step in finding the LCM. To find the LCM, we need to first list the multiples of each number. \n\nFor 8, the multiples are: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120...\n\nFor 20, the multiples are: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120...\n\nAs you can see, the smallest number that appears in both lists is 40.
