Your previous struggles with identifying common multiples and addition might be connected to this concept. Let's break it down together.\n\nFor \"Identify larger quantity -- subtraction,\" we're looking for the larger number between two given quantities after subtracting one from the other. Think of it like comparing the difference between two numbers.\n\nTo build your confidence, let's try to relate it to your past learning. Remember when we worked on identifying common multiples? We discussed that multiples are the products of a number and an integer. Now, let's apply a similar logic to subtraction.\n\n**Practice Question:**\nLet's try a practice question to help you build your skills. Imagine you have 18 pencils in one box and 12 pencils in another box. If you take away the pencils from the smaller box (12) from the larger box (18), which box will have more pencils left?\n\nA) Box 1 (18)\nB) Box 2 (12)\nC) Both boxes will have the same number of pencils left\nD) We can't compare them because they have different numbers of pencils\n\nPlease choose your answer.",

To identify the larger quantity in a subtraction problem, we need to subtract the smaller number from the larger number. \n\nIn this case, we have two boxes: Box 1 (15) and Box 2 (12). To determine which box has the larger quantity, we need to compare the numbers inside the boxes. Since 15 is greater than 12, Box 1 (15) has the larger quantity. Therefore, the correct answer is A) Box 1 (15).\n\nDon't worry, it's a tough concept, and we can practice more to improve your understanding of identifying larger quantities in subtraction.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question that might help you practice identifying larger quantities in subtraction. Here's a new scenario:\n\nYou have two boxes:\n\nBox 1: 18 pencils\nBox 2: 7 pencils\n\nWhich box has the larger quantity of pencils?",

Remember, we talked about how common multiples are related to finding the largest quantity. Since you struggled with identifying common multiples earlier, it might be worth reviewing that concept again.\n\nIn the context of subtraction, thinking about common multiples can help you find the largest quantity by looking for the number that is a multiple of both numbers being subtracted. However, in this specific question, it seems we were focusing more on understanding the concept of subtraction itself.\n\nLet's break it down: When we subtract one number from another, we're essentially finding the difference between them. To identify the larger quantity, we need to consider which number is larger and how much it is larger than the other.\n\nFor example, if we have 15 - 7, we can see that 15 is larger than 7. We can count how many 7s are in 15 to find the difference. In this case, we can see that 7 goes into 15 twice with one left over (7 x 2 = 14), so the difference is 1.\n\nIn your case, you chose option B) Box 2 (12). However, we didn't discuss the specific question, so I'm not sure what you were trying to solve. If you'd like to share the question or try another one, I'm here to help you understand the concept better.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question that might help solidify your understanding of identifying larger quantities in subtraction.

That's completely okay, and it's great that you're acknowledging your struggles. \n\nLet's review what we've discussed earlier about identifying larger quantities. We've talked about how it can be tricky, especially when it comes to subtraction. I think we need to revisit the concept of identifying common multiples, as you had some trouble with that in the past.\n\nRemember, when we're comparing two numbers in a subtraction problem, we need to find the common multiple of the two numbers first. Then, we can determine which one is larger. \n\nFor example, let's say we have the problem: 48 - 24. To identify the larger quantity, we need to find the common multiple of 48 and 24, which is 48. Since 48 is greater than 24, the larger quantity is 48.\n\nLet's try to practice with a few more examples, and I'll give you some hints to help you feel more confident.

That's completely okay, and it's great that you're acknowledging your uncertainty. However, let's take a closer look at the question. In the subtraction problem 96 - 72, we're looking for the larger number. To do this, we can try to recall our previous learning on addition. Remember, we discussed how addition and subtraction are related operations. When we add a number to itself, it's like combining two quantities together. For example, 72 + 0 is 72, and 72 + 24 is 96.\n\nIn the context of subtraction, we can think of it as the opposite of addition. So, if 72 + 24 equals 96, then 96 - 24 would equal 72. This means that the larger number in the subtraction problem 96 - 72 is actually 96. You were close, but let's try to remember that in subtraction, we're looking for the number that remains after we remove the smaller quantity.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build your confidence in identifying larger quantities in subtraction.

To identify the larger quantity, we need to think about which number is bigger. In this case, 96 is indeed a larger number than 72.\n\nSo, the correct answer is A) 96, not B) 72. Don't worry if it was a tough one - it's all part of the learning process.\n\n**To help you improve, let's review some key concepts:**\n\n1.  You might want to recall that when we're dealing with subtraction, we're finding the difference between two numbers. In this case, we're subtracting 72 from 96.\n2.  To identify the larger quantity, think about which number is bigger. In this case, 96 is a larger number than 72.\n\n**Now, let's practice some more!

However, let's take a closer look at your reasoning. You correctly identified that 108 is greater than 85 and 192, but you didn't compare it to 123. In this case, 123 is actually greater than 108, so the larger quantity is actually C) 123.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you mentioned the other choices aren't part of the problem, but that's not entirely accurate. The question is asking which number is the larger quantity, and we need to compare all the options to determine that. So, let's try to improve your comparison skills and make sure we're considering all the options.\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nLet's try another question to practice identifying the larger quantity in a subtraction problem.

When identifying the larger quantity in a subtraction problem, we only need to compare the numbers in the problem itself, not the other options.\n\nLet's try to break it down further: When we look at the numbers 192, 85, 123, and 108, we can see that 192 is indeed the largest. But if we had a problem like 108 - 85, we would be comparing 108 and 85 to find the larger quantity.
