Based on your past learning, it seems like you might be struggling with applying the concepts to actual problems. Remember, we've discussed Time problems and Types, Naming, and Estimating previously, but it seems like we need to revisit and reinforce those concepts before diving into Solving Linear Inequalities.\n\n**Practice Question 2: Solving Linear Inequalities**\n\nLet's try a new approach. Here's a question that combines the concepts you've learned previously with Solving Linear Inequalities:\n\nQuestion: Tom has been saving money for a new bike and has $120. He wants to buy a bike that costs between $150 and $180. If he saves $15 per week, how many weeks will it take him to buy the bike?\n\n**What do you think? Can you solve this problem?**",

Based on our recent dialogue and your past learning, I noticed that you struggled with a Time question and had difficulty applying Types, Naming, and Estimating. It might be that these areas are connected to your struggles with Solving Linear Inequalities. Don't worry, we can work through this together.\n\nTo help you better understand, let's break down what we've learned so far: you've shown improvement in some areas, but Solving Linear Inequalities is an area where you need more practice and review.\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\nLet's try a simpler one. We'll build up your confidence step by step. Here's your next practice question:\n\nQuestion: Solve the inequality: 2x + 5 > 11\n\nTake your time, and remember to apply the concepts we've discussed earlier. What do you think the solution is?",

To isolate x, you need to divide both sides by 2. So, the correct solution would be: x > 3\n\nIt's also worth noting that you initially stated x < 3, which is the opposite of the correct solution.

You're close to solving the problem, but there's a small step that's tripping you up. Let's review the steps again.\n\nYou initially had the inequality \\(x + 5 > 8\\). You correctly subtracted 5 from both sides to get \\(x > 3\\). However, the original question was asking for a solution where x is less than, not greater than. To get the correct solution, you need to flip the inequality sign when dividing or multiplying both sides by a negative number.\n\nSo, the correct steps would be:\n\n1. Subtract 5 from both sides: \\(x > 3\\)\n2. Subtract 3 from both sides: \\(x - 3 > 0\\)\n3. Multiply both sides by -1 (remember, this flips the inequality sign): \\(-(x - 3) < 0\\)\n4. Distribute the negative sign: \\(-x + 3 < 0\\)\n5. Subtract 3 from both sides: \\(-x < -3\\)\n6. Multiply both sides by -1 (remember, this flips the inequality sign): \\(x > 3\\)\n\nHowever, since the original inequality was greater than, and you subtracted 5 from both sides, the correct solution is actually \\(x < 3\\).\n\nLet's practice this concept some more to help solidify your understanding.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nSolve the inequality: \\(x - 2 < 5\\).",

When you do this, the correct direction of the inequality sign remains the same if you're adding a positive number. However, since you're adding a positive number (2), the correct inequality sign should remain as is.\n\nSo, the correct step would be:\n\nx - 2 + 2 < 5 + 2\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx < 7\n\nTherefore, the solution set would be all numbers less than 7.\n\nDon't worry about mixing up the direction; it's a common mistake, and we can work on it together.

Let's review the steps together to make sure you understand where you went wrong.\n\nHere's a reminder of the key concept: when dividing or multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative or positive number, the direction of the inequality sign remains the same if the number is positive, but flips if the number is negative.\n\nNow, let's move on to practice some more problems to help solidify your understanding of solving linear inequalities.\n\n**Practice Question 1:**\n\nSolve the inequality: \\(4x - 2 < 14\\)\n\nWhat are your steps to solve this inequality?",

      "content": "**Feedback on the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nGreat effort in attempting to solve the inequality. However, there's a crucial step you missed. When dividing both sides of an inequality by a number (in this case, 2), you need to flip the inequality sign because division by a positive number reverses the inequality. So, the correct step would be:\n\n\\(2x > 8\\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\(x > 8/2\\)\n\n\\(x > 4\\)\n\nNotice the change in the inequality sign. The correct solution is \\(x > 4\\).\n\nTo help reinforce this concept, let's review why this happens. When you divide both sides by a positive number, the direction of the inequality remains the same if the number is positive, but flips if it's negative. Since 2 is a positive number, we flip the inequality sign.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nTo help you solidify your understanding of solving linear inequalities, let's try another one:\n\nSolve for x in the inequality: \\(5x - 2 < 13\\)\n\nThink you can give it a try?",

You've been doing great in understanding the overall process, but you're getting stuck on the finer details. Let's review the concept together. When you divide both sides of an inequality by a number (in this case, 2), you need to flip the inequality sign because it's the opposite operation of multiplication. Think of it like this: dividing is the opposite of multiplying, so the direction of the inequality also changes.\n\nFor example, if you have 2x > 6, when you divide both sides by 2, the inequality becomes x > 3. But if you have 2x < 6, when you divide both sides by 2, the inequality becomes x < 3. Does that make sense?\n\nNow, let's try another question to see if you can apply this concept. Remember, the key is to remember that when you divide both sides by a number, you need to flip the inequality sign.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nSolve the inequality: 4x + 2 > 14\n\nThis question targets your weak area of 'Solving Linear Inequalities' with a specific focus on dividing both sides of an inequality by a number.",

You've been doing great in understanding the overall process, but there seems to be a gap in applying the rules when working with division. Specifically, you forgot to consider the direction of the inequality sign when dividing both sides by a number.\n\nWhen dividing both sides of an inequality by a number, you need to flip the direction of the inequality sign if the number is negative. This is because division by a negative number is equivalent to multiplication by its reciprocal, which changes the direction of the inequality.\n\nFor example, if you have an inequality like 3x > 9 and you divide both sides by -2, you should flip the inequality sign to get x < -3/2.\n\nLet's practice this concept together to help you solidify your understanding.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nSolve the inequality: 2x - 5 > 11\n\nWhat's your answer?",
