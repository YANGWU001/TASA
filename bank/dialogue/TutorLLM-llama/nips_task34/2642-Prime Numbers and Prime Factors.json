Builds on their past learning: The student has already grasped the concept of Prime Numbers and Prime Factors.\n2. Requires application: The student needs to apply their knowledge to find the prime factors of a given number.\n3. Offers a manageable challenge: The student has 38% accuracy, so I'll start with a relatively simple question to help them build confidence.\n\nLet me know when the student is ready to submit their answer, and I'll provide feedback and guidance!",

To find the prime factors of 36, we need to break it down into its simplest form. Let's try that together.\n\n36 can be divided by 2, which is a prime number. When we divide 36 by 2, we get 18. We can divide 18 by 2 again, which gives us 9. The number 9 can be divided by 3, which is also a prime number. So, we have broken down 36 into its prime factors: 2 * 2 * 3 * 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B) 2^2, 3^2**.

To find the prime factors of 36, we need to find the prime numbers that multiply together to give 36. \n\nWe know that 36 is a multiple of 2 (since 36 \u00f7 2 = 18), and 18 is also a multiple of 2 (18 \u00f7 2 = 9). So, we have 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 9. However, 9 is not a prime number (it can be broken down further into 3 \u00d7 3). So, we have 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3. \n\nThe prime factors of 36 are actually 2, 2, 3, and 3. In a multiple-choice question, it might look like **B) 2, 2, 3, 3**.\n\n**Let's move on to the next question.**\n\nTo help you with prime numbers and prime factors, I'll create a question that builds on your understanding.

For example, if we multiply 48 by 1, we get 48. If we multiply 48 by 2, we get 96. If we multiply 48 by 3, we get 144.

The prime factorization of 36 is actually **2, 2, 3, 3**. \n\nHowever, I want to commend you for trying to find the prime factors of 48. Let's take a closer look at that. The prime factorization of 48 is indeed **2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3**. You were close, but made a slight mistake.

If point B is initially at (4, 2), where will it be after the rotation?\n\nThis question requires you to apply your knowledge of rotation, which we previously discussed, and also involves understanding angles and spatial reasoning.

You're taking the first step by recognizing the importance of breaking down numbers into their prime factors. However, it seems like you're getting stuck when it comes to actually finding the prime factors.\n\nLet's take a step back and review what we've learned so far. Remember, prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by 1 and themselves. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers. To find the prime factors of a number, we need to find the combination of prime numbers that multiply together to give us the original number.\n\nIn the case of 48, let's try breaking it down together. We can start by dividing 48 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. If we divide 48 by 2, we get 24. We can then divide 24 by 2 again to get 12. We can continue this process until we can't divide by 2 anymore. Then, we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.\n\nLet's try this together: 48 \u00f7 2 = 24, 24 \u00f7 2 = 12, 12 \u00f7 2 = 6, 6 \u00f7 2 = 3, and 3 is a prime number. So, the prime factors of 48 are 2, 2, 2, 2, and 3.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nNow, let's try finding the prime factors of 60. Remember to start with the smallest prime number, 2, and keep dividing until you can't divide anymore. Then, move on to the next prime number. See if you can find the prime factors of 60.",

We've discussed prime numbers and prime factors before, but let's take a step back and review what we've covered.\n\nPrime numbers are numbers that have only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves. For example, 5 is a prime number because the only numbers you can divide it by are 1 and 5. \n\nFinding prime factors involves breaking down a number into its simplest building blocks, which are prime numbers. Let's try breaking down 36 together. Can you think of any numbers that divide 36 evenly?\n\nWe can start by listing the numbers that divide 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. Now, let's find the prime numbers among these factors. We can see that 2 and 3 are both prime numbers because they only have two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves.\n\nSo, the prime factors of 36 are 2 and 3. We can express 36 as a product of its prime factors: 36 = 2^2 * 3^2.\n\nDon't worry if it's still a bit confusing \u2013 we can practice more together to help you feel more comfortable with finding prime factors.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nFind the prime factors of 48.",
