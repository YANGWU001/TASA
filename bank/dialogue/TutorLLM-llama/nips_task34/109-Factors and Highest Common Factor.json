Factors and Highest Common Factor (HCF) can be a bit tricky, but with practice and review, you'll get the hang of it.\n\nLet's review what we know so far. Factors are the numbers that divide a given number exactly without leaving a remainder. For example, the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nThe Highest Common Factor (HCF) is the largest number that is a factor of two or more numbers. For instance, the HCF of 12 and 18 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 18 exactly.\n\nLet's try another question to build your confidence. \n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nFind the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 24 and 30.\n\nPlease take your time, and I'll be here to guide you through it.",

Let's break it down together. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. As you can see, the highest number that appears in both lists is 6. So, the HCF of 24 and 30 is indeed 6.\n\nDon't worry if you got it wrong - it's all part of the learning process. Remember, factors are the numbers that divide a number without leaving a remainder. And the HCF is the largest factor that two or more numbers have in common.\n\nLet's try another question to help you build your confidence.

However, I want to point out that just because both numbers are divisible by a certain number, it doesn't necessarily mean that's the HCF. Think about it like this: if we list the factors of 18 and 24, we get:\n\nFactors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\nFactors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\nAs we can see, both 18 and 24 share the factors 1, 2, 3, and 6. But, we need to find the largest one they have in common. You were close with 12, but let's review the list together. The largest common factor is actually 6. So, the correct answer is 6.\n\n**Next Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to help you build your confidence. What is the HCF of 40 and 60?

However, I want to point out that listing a few factors is a good start, but we need to be more thorough. For the question about the HCF of 40 and 60, you mentioned that the factors of 40 are 1 and 2, but we need to list all the factors for both numbers to find the correct HCF.\n\nLet's complete the list of factors for both 40 and 60:\n\n- Factors of 40: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40\n- Factors of 60: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60\n\nNow, let's look for the common factors between the two numbers. We can see that the numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20 are common factors. The highest common factor among these is 20.\n\nSo, the correct answer is that the HCF of 40 and 60 is 20, not 10.\n\n**Practice Question:**\n\nLet's try another question to practice finding the HCF.

To find the HCF, we need to look for the highest factor that is present in both lists. Let's take a closer look at the factors of 48 and 72.\n\nYou listed the factors correctly:\n\n- Factors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48\n- Factors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\n\nNow, let's identify the common factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.
