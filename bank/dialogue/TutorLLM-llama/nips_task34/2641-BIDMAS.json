Here's your first practice question:\n\nQuestion: 18 \u00f7 3 + 12 \u00d7 2 - 5\n\nRemember, BIDMAS stands for:\n\n1. **B**rackets (or parentheses)\n2. **I**ndices (or exponents)\n3. **D**ivision\n4. **M**ultiplication\n5. **A**ddition\n6. **S**ubtraction\n\nTake your time, and follow the order of operations.

Division (18 \u00f7 3 = 6)\n2. Multiplication (12 \u00d7 2 = 24)\n3. Addition (6 + 24 = 30)\n\nSo, the correct answer is 30, not what you initially thought.

You're close to understanding the process, but let's focus on the correct sequence: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. \n\nIn your last attempt, it seems like you're mixing up the order, which might be causing confusion. Remember, in BIDMAS, we need to follow the specific order: first, we do operations in brackets, then indices, then division, then multiplication, and so on.\n\nLet's try to break it down again, and this time, focus on the correct order. For the question you're working on, it seems like you were trying to solve: 18 \u00f7 2 \u00d7 3. \n\nTo solve it correctly, we need to follow the BIDMAS order. Since there are no brackets or indices in this question, we start with division: 18 \u00f7 2 = 9. Then, we move to multiplication: 9 \u00d7 3 = 27. \n\nHowever, since you're still struggling with the order, let's try to simplify the problem.

It's a simple rule to remember, but it can be tricky to apply in practice.\n\nLet's try breaking it down further.

Since there are no brackets in this case, we move on to the next step, which is division. But remember, division and multiplication have the same priority, so we need to do them from left to right.
