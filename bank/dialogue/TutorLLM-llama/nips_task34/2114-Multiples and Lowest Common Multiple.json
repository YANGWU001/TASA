To find the LCM of 12 and another number, we can start by listing the multiples of 12:\n\n12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, ...\n\nNow, I'd like to ask, do you remember how to find the multiples of a number?\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\nWhat are the multiples of 9?

As you can see, the smallest number that appears in both lists is 24. So, the LCM of 6 and 8 is 24.\n\nNow, let's try to apply this concept to the problem we started with. We were asked to find the LCM of 12 and... I'll give you a hint, it's a number we've worked with before, like in the squares and cubes question.

You're correct that 9 and 15 go into 30 without a remainder, but you're mixing up the concept of multiples. Let's review what we've discussed before.

We've discussed how to identify multiples of numbers and how to find the least common multiple (LCM) between two numbers. It seems like you're having trouble applying these concepts to find the LCM.\n\nTo help you improve, let's focus on the following key points:\n\n1. **Identify multiples**: We need to find the multiples of both numbers (e.g., multiples of 9 and multiples of 15).\n2. **List the multiples**: Write down the multiples of each number to see if there's a common multiple.\n3. **Find the smallest multiple**: Identify the smallest multiple that appears in both lists.\n\nIn your previous attempt, you mentioned that 9 and 15 go into 30 without a remainder.

You've had trouble with similar concepts like types of numbers, squares, and factors, but you've also had some success with mental multiplication and division problems. It's possible that you might be getting confused between the LCM and the highest common factor (HCF).
