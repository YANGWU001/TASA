Given that the student has **only about 30% mastery** of percents and shows **minimal forgetting**, it's important to start with a **simple, concrete, and foundational** question that builds confidence and reinforces the core concept \u2014 **what a percent is and how to find a percent of a number**.\n\nWe\u2019ll use a real-world, relatable scenario to make it engaging and reduce cognitive load.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc First Practice Question:\n\n**What is 20% of 50?**\n\n> *Hint: Think of \"percent\" as \"per 100.\" So, 20% means 20 out of 100. You can find 20% of 50 by multiplying 50 \u00d7 (20 \u00f7 100).*\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Why this works**:\n- It\u2019s simple and builds from basic multiplication and division.\n- It avoids complex word problems or multi-step questions.\n- It aligns with the student\u2019s current level \u2014 not too hard, not too easy.\n- The hint gently guides without giving the answer away.\n- It reinforces the core idea: **percent = part per 100**.\n\nOnce the student answers, we can build up to more challenging problems (like finding the whole from a part and percent, or word problems), but this first step is about **building confidence and fluency**.\n\nLet me know when they\u2019ve tried it \u2014 I\u2019ll be ready to provide feedback or the next step! \ud83d\ude0a",
