Based on the student's profile \u2014 showing **low mastery (~20%)**, **moderate forgetting (score 0.22)**, and a clear need for **reinforcement and foundational understanding** of the concept of *discount* \u2014 the first practice question should be:\n\n\u2705 **Simple, clear, and directly focused on the core idea**  \n\u2705 **Builds confidence with a concrete, real-world scenario**  \n\u2705 **Reinforces the basic definition and calculation** of discount  \n\u2705 **Avoids complexity or multi-step problems initially**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd First Practice Question:\n\n**A pair of shoes originally costs $60. A store offers a 20% discount. What is the amount of the discount?**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why this works:\n- Focuses on **finding the discount amount**, not the final price (which is more complex and builds on the same idea).\n- Uses a **familiar, real-world context** (shoes) to make it relatable.\n- The 20% discount is a common and manageable percentage, helping the student build confidence.\n- Encourages the student to apply the formula:  \n  **Discount Amount = Original Price \u00d7 (Discount Percentage as a Decimal)**  \n  \u2192 $60 \u00d7 0.20 = $12\n\nThis small step helps rebuild the student\u2019s understanding before moving to more complex problems (like finding sale price or percent discount from final price).\n\n---\n\n\u2705 Next step: After solving, guide the student to **explain their thinking** (e.g., \u201cI multiplied 60 by 0.20 because 20% means 20 out of 100\u201d).  \nThis reinforces retrieval and addresses the moderate forgetting issue.\n\nWould you like a follow-up question or a version with a different scenario (like clothing, electronics, or a sale at a store)?",

Let\u2019s take a slow, clear, and supportive approach so you can build confidence step by step.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Simple Explanation: What Is a Discount?\n\nA **discount** is a reduction in the original price of something. It's like getting money \"off\" the price you\u2019d normally pay.\n\nFor example:  \nIf a shirt costs $50 and there's a 10% discount, you save $5 \u2014 that\u2019s the *discount amount*.  \nYou still pay $45 (the original price minus the discount).\n\nSo, to find the **discount amount**, we use this simple formula:\n\n> **Discount Amount = Original Price \u00d7 (Discount Percentage \u00f7 100)**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 In math, \"percent\" means \"out of 100\", so:\n- 20% = 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.20\n- 10% = 10 \u00f7 100 = 0.10\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Let\u2019s go back to your first question:\n> **A pair of shoes originally costs $60. A store offers a 20% discount. What is the amount of the discount?**\n\nWe want to find **how much money you save**.\n\nStep-by-step:\n1. Original price = $60  \n2. Discount = 20% \u2192 convert to decimal: 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.20  \n3. Multiply: $60 \u00d7 0.20 = **$12**\n\n\u2705 So, the **discount amount is $12**.\n\nYou save $12 \u2014 that\u2019s the answer.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac Now, try to explain it in your own words:\n> \"I multiplied 60 by 0.20 because 20% means 20 out of 100, and that\u2019s how much of the original price I save.\"\n\nIf you're not sure, that\u2019s okay \u2014 just say what you think. We\u2019ll go over it together.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (Even Simpler & More Relatable):\n\n**A toy car costs $30. There\u2019s a 10% discount. How much money do you save?**\n\n\u2705 This is easier because:\n- The numbers are smaller ($30 instead of $60)\n- The discount is 10% (a common, simple percentage)\n- It reinforces the same idea: **discount = original \u00d7 decimal**\n\nTry solving it on your own first \u2014 just write down what you think the answer is, then we\u2019ll go over it together.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 After you answer, I\u2019ll help you explain your thinking and build on it.\n\nWould you like to try it now? \ud83d\ude0a",

Let\u2019s fix this together.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Let\u2019s Clarify: Is $6 the right answer?\n\nWe know:\n- Original price = $30  \n- Discount = 10%  \n- 10% means **10 out of 100**, or **0.10** in decimal form\n\nSo the correct calculation is:\n> $30 \u00d7 0.10 = **$3**\n\n\u2705 That\u2019s correct.\n\nNow, why did you think $6?\n\nMaybe because:\n- You might be thinking of **10% of 30** as \"half of 30\" \u2014 but no, 10% is **not half**.  \n- Half of 30 is 15%, not 10%.  \n- 20% of 30 is $6 \u2014 that\u2019s where the $6 comes from! \ud83d\ude05\n\nAh \u2014 **you're mixing up 10% with 20%**.\n\nLet\u2019s make that clear:\n\n| Percent | Decimal | 10% of $30 | 20% of $30 |\n|--------|--------|------------|------------|\n| 10%    | 0.10   | $3         | $6         |\n| 20%    | 0.20   | $6         | $12        |\n\nSo:\n- \u2705 10% of $30 = **$3**\n- \u274c 10% of $30 is **not** $6 \u2014 that would be **20%**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Therefore, your **answer of $6 is incorrect** for a 10% discount.  \nBut you were **very close** \u2014 you just confused the percentage.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Key Takeaway:\n> **Percent discounts are not about guessing or \u201cfeeling\u201d the amount \u2014 they follow a simple rule:**  \n>  \n> **Discount Amount = Original Price \u00d7 (Percent \u00f7 100)**  \n>  \n> So:  \n> - 10% \u2192 0.10 \u2192 $30 \u00d7 0.10 = $3  \n> - 20% \u2192 0.20 \u2192 $30 \u00d7 0.20 = $6  \n> - 50% \u2192 0.50 \u2192 $30 \u00d7 0.50 = $15  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 The **percentage directly determines the decimal**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Let\u2019s Practice with a Real-World Example:\nImagine you go to a toy store and see a **10% discount** on a toy car that costs $30.\n\n- The store says: \u201cYou save 10% \u2014 that means you pay only 90% of the original price.\u201d\n- So you save **10% of $30**, which is $3.\n- You pay $27 (because $30 \u2013 $3 = $27).\n\n\u2705 That makes sense! And it matches the math.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n> The amount of the discount is **$3**.  \n> (Not $6 \u2014 that\u2019s for a 20% discount.)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (Even Simpler & Designed to Build Confidence):\n\n> **A book costs $20. There\u2019s a 5% discount. How much money do you save?**\n\n\u2705 Why this works:\n- 5% is a very small, manageable percentage\n- $20 is a small, easy number to work with\n- Reinforces the same concept: **discount = original \u00d7 decimal**\n- Builds confidence by making the math simple and predictable\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Try solving it on your own first:  \nWrite down what you think the discount is, and then we\u2019ll go over it together.\n\nAfter you answer, I\u2019ll help you explain your thinking \u2014 just like we did before.\n\nWould you like to try it now? \ud83d\ude0a  \n(You can say: \u201cI think it\u2019s\u2026\u201d, or \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d \u2014 either way, we\u2019ll go over it!)",

There\u2019s a 50% discount. How much do you save?**\n\n\u2705 Why this works:\n- $4 is a nice, round number \u2014 easy to work with  \n- 50% is **super familiar** \u2014 it means *half*  \n- It reinforces the **same rule** in a new context  \n- The answer is **intuitively obvious**: half of $4 = **$2**  \n- And we can verify it with math:  \n  \u2192 50% = 0.50  \n  \u2192 $4 \u00d7 0.50 = **$2** \u2705  \n- This gives you a **strong mental anchor**:  \n  \u2192 50% of anything = **half of it**  \n  \u2192 25% = **a",

There\u2019s a 50% discount. How much do you save?**\n\n\u2705 The **discount amount** is **the amount you save** \u2014 it\u2019s **not** a price after tax, or after a second discount, or after any subtraction.  \nIt\u2019s **directly** calculated as:\n\n> **Discount = Original Price \u00d7 (Percent \u00f7 100)**\n\nSo:\n- $4 \u00d7 (50 \u00f7 100) = $4 \u00d7 0.50 = **$2.00**\n\n\u2705 So, you **save $2.00** \u2014 not $1.50.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why $1.50 is not correct (and why your intuition is actually *very* close):\n- You said: *\"Maybe you have to subtract something like tax or another cost\"* \u2014 that\u2019s a **great instinct**!\n- But in **basic discount problems**, we **don\u2019t include tax, fees, or other costs** \u2014 unless it\u2019s explicitly mentioned.\n- The **discount is pure** \u2014 it\u2019s just a percentage off the original price.\n- So, **50% off $4 = $2 saved** \u2014 full stop.\n- $1.50 would be **37.5%** of $4 \u2014 which is *not* 50%.  \n  (Because 1.50 \u00f7 4 = 0.375 = 37.5% \u2014 so that\u2019s a smaller discount.)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So, **you save $2.00**, not $1.50.  \nAnd your idea that \"maybe it\u2019s less because of tax\" is **a really smart, real-world question** \u2014 but in this problem, **there\u2019s no tax**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Why This Is a Big Win:\n- You recognized that **multiplying by the decimal** is the rule \u2014 and that\u2019s **exactly right**.\n- You noticed that **\"half\" = 50%** \u2014 and that\u2019s the anchor!\n- You didn\u2019t just memorize the formula \u2014 you **connected it to meaning**.\n- You\u2019re now seeing that:\n  - **Discount = amount saved**\n  - **It\u2019s not a final price** \u2014 it\u2019s a reduction\n  - **It doesn\u2019t involve subtraction of tax or other costs** (unless told)\n- You\u2019re building **intuitive number sense** \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes math powerful.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n> You save **$2.00** on a $4 shirt with a 50% discount.  \n> (Not $1.50 \u2014 that would be 37.5% of $4. 50% of $4 is exactly half \u2014 $4 \u00f7 2 = $2.)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 Next Step: Build Even More Confidence \u2014 With a **Real-World, Intuitive Question**\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 **A pair of shoes costs $30. There\u2019s a 20% discount. How much do you save?**\n\n\u2705 Why this works:\n- $30 is a larger, more realistic price \u2014 helps build confidence in real-world math\n- 20% is a common discount (like at stores) \u2014 so it's familiar and meaningful\n- You can **verify it two ways**:\n  1.
