    "content": "**Student's Last Answer Explanation:**\n\nThe student's last answer, **55 degrees**, shows a mix of correct and incorrect steps. They correctly recalled that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and added the measures of the two given angles (25 degrees and 90 degrees), which equals 115 degrees. However, they then struggled to determine the measure of the third angle, considering an incorrect approach of guessing the remaining amount. This demonstrates that the student is still developing their understanding of the concept and needs more practice to build their confidence.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven that the student is making progress but still needs more practice with Angles in Triangles, let's try another question that builds on the same concept but with a slight variation. Here's the next question:\n\n**Question 9:**\n\nIn a triangle, if one angle measures 60 degrees and the other angle measures 30 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?\n\nA) 30 degrees\nB) 45 degrees\nC) 60 degrees\nD) 75 degrees\nE) 90 degrees\n\n**Reasoning skill required:** The student needs to recall that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees and apply this knowledge to find the measure of the third angle.\n\nThis question introduces a new challenge by having two angles that are equal, which requires the student to think critically about how to find the measure of the third angle, making it a good opportunity to reinforce their understanding and build their confidence.",

    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's last answer, **45 degrees**, shows a correct application of the concept that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. They correctly added the measures of the two given angles (60 degrees and 30 degrees), which equals 90 degrees. Then, they subtracted this sum from 180 degrees to find the measure of the third angle, resulting in 90 degrees. However, they initially considered a different answer of 30 degrees, which indicates a slight moment of uncertainty, but ultimately arrived at the correct answer.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven that the student has shown a correct understanding of the concept but still needs more practice with Angles in Triangles, let's try another question that builds on the same concept but with a slight variation.
