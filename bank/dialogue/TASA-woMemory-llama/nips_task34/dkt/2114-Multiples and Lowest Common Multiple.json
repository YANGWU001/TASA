However, it's worth noting that the student's reasoning is not entirely accurate, as they assumed that 48 appears later in the 8-multiple list, which is not necessarily true. The correct reasoning should be that both lists contain 48, making it the smallest common multiple. Nonetheless, the student's answer is correct, and this is a good opportunity to reinforce the concept of LCM.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's moderate retention and forgetting score, the next question should be slightly more challenging but still within their comfort zone. Here's the next practice question:\n\n**Question:** Find the LCM of 9 and 15.\n\n**Options:**\n\nA) 27\nB) 45\nC) 63\nD) 90\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n- The question is about finding the LCM, which aligns with the student's requested topic.\n- The numbers 9 and 15 are a bit larger than the previous question, but still manageable for a student with a 44% mastery level.\n- The options are clear and concise, allowing the student to choose the correct answer without confusion.\n- The LCM of 9 and 15 requires the student to apply their knowledge of multiples and LCM, making it a suitable challenge for the student.",
