    "content": "Based on the student's profile, I've generated a practice question that will help them build a strong foundation in Prime Numbers and Prime Factors.\n\n**Question 1:**\n\nWhat is the prime factorization of the number 36?\n\nA) 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5\nB) 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\nC) 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4\nD) 4 \u00d7 9\n\n**Why this question?**\n\nThis question is a great starting point for the student because it:\n\n1.  Builds on basic multiplication facts: Students who struggle with prime numbers and factors often need to recall basic multiplication facts. This question requires the student to apply their knowledge of multiplication to factorize the number 36.\n2.  Introduces prime factorization: The question asks for the prime factorization of 36, which is a fundamental concept in prime numbers and factors.\n3.  Uses a relatively small number: The number 36 is a manageable size for a beginner, allowing the student to focus on the concept rather than getting overwhelmed by a large number.\n4.  Provides multiple-choice options: The multiple-choice format helps the student recognize the correct answer and understand the reasoning behind it.\n\n**Answer:** The correct answer is B) 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3, as 36 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3.",

They correctly identified 2 as a factor of 36 because it's an even number. However, when breaking down the remaining part, they incorrectly identified 18 as 3 \u00d7 6 instead of 3 \u00d7 3. Additionally, they mistakenly added a factor of 5, which is not a factor of 36.\n\n**Correcting the Mistake:**\n\nTo find the prime factorization of 36, let's break it down correctly. 36 \u00f7 2 is indeed 18. Then, 18 can be further broken down into 3 \u00d7 6, but 6 can be broken down into 2 \u00d7 3. Therefore, the correct prime factorization of 36 is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding and the need for improvement, the next question should build upon the concept of prime factorization and introduce a slightly more challenging scenario.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\nWhat is the prime factorization of the number 48?\n\nA) 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3\nB) 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3\nC) 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3\nD) 4 \u00d7 6\n\nThis question:\n\n1.

Then, 24 can be further broken down into 2 \u00d7 12. 12 can be broken down into 2 \u00d7 6, and 6 can be broken down into 2 \u00d7 3.
