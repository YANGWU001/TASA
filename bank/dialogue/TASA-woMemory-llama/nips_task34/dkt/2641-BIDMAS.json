    "content": "**Concise explanation of the student's last answer:**\n\nThe student's answer of 6 is partially correct, as they correctly performed the division operation (24 \u00f7 4 = 6). However, they struggled to apply the correct order of operations, showing uncertainty about whether to add 1 before or after the division. This indicates that the student still needs practice in applying BIDMAS rules consistently, particularly in the context of division and addition.\n\n**Next question tailored to the student's profile:**\n\n**Question:** 12 \u00f7 3 + 4 = ?\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n- It tests the student's understanding of the order of operations (BIDMAS) in the context of mental division and addition, building on previous questions.\n- It involves simple numbers, making it easier for the student to perform the calculations mentally.\n- The question requires the student to apply the correct order of operations (division before addition) to arrive at the correct answer.\n- The presence of a division operation will help the student to practice the correct order of operations, and the addition operation will help them to apply the correct order in a sequence of operations.\n\n**Correct answer:** 8 (12 \u00f7 3 = 4, then 4 + 4 = 8)\n\n**Expected learning outcome:** After practicing this question, the student should be able to demonstrate improved accuracy in applying BIDMAS rules, specifically in mental division and addition, with a focus on the correct order of operations in a sequence of operations.",
