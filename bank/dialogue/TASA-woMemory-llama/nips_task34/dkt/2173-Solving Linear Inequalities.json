    "content": "Given the student's profile, it's essential to start with a question that is slightly below their current mastery level to help them build confidence and gradually increase their understanding. Here's a practice question to help the student improve their skills in solving linear inequalities:\n\n**Question 1: Simple Inequality with One Variable**\n\nSolve for x: 2x + 5 > 11\n\nA) x > 2\nB) x < 3\nC) x > 3\nD) x < 2\n\n**Explanation and Guidance:**\n\nTo solve this inequality, the student needs to isolate the variable x on one side of the inequality sign. They can start by subtracting 5 from both sides of the inequality, which will give them 2x > 6. Then, they can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x. This will result in x > 3. The correct answer is C) x > 3.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1.  The question is straightforward and focuses on a basic concept, allowing the student to build a solid foundation.\n2.  It involves a simple inequality with one variable, making it easier for the student to manage and solve.\n3.  The solution requires a single step, which will help the student develop their problem-solving skills without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThis question should help the student regain their confidence and provide a gentle refresher on solving linear inequalities, which will make it easier for them to tackle more complex problems in the future.",

    "content": "## Step 1: Explanation of the Student's Last Answer\n\nThe student has made a great effort in solving the inequality 2x - 5 < 11. They correctly isolated the variable x by adding 5 to both sides, obtaining 2x < 16, and then divided both sides by 2, remembering that the inequality sign remains the same since 2 is a positive number. Their solution, x < 8, is accurate.\n\n## Step 2: Provide Feedback and Encouragement\n\nYour approach is spot on, and your calculations are accurate. The correct solution is indeed x < 8. You're getting closer to mastering linear inequalities, and your confidence is growing. Keep it up, and you'll become more proficient in solving these types of problems.\n\n## Step 3: Next Question\n\nGiven your recent progress and the fact that you're still building your confidence in solving linear inequalities, let's try a question that's slightly more challenging but still within your grasp. Here's the next question:\n\n**Question 5: Solving an Inequality with a Mixed Coefficient and Absolute Value**\n\nSolve for x: |4x - 2| > 7\n\nA) x > 3\nB) x < 3\nC) x > -1.75\nD) x < -1.75\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n1.  It involves an absolute value, which will help you practice solving inequalities with absolute value expressions.\n2.  The question requires two steps to solve, making it a bit more challenging but still manageable, allowing you to build on your previous success.\n3.  The solution will help you develop your problem-solving skills and reinforce your understanding of linear inequalities.\n\nTake your time, and remember to carefully follow the steps to solve the inequality.",
