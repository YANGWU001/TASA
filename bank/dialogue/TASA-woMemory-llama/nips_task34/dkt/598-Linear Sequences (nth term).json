What is the 5th term of this sequence?\n\nA) 9\nB) 11\nC) 13\nD) 15\nE) 17\n\n**Reasoning Skill:** This question requires the student to apply the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: an = a1 + (n - 1)d, where a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference. Since the sequence increases by 2 each time, d = 2. The first term, a1, is given as 3. The student needs to find the 5th term (n = 5), so they'll use the formula: a5 = 3 + (5 - 1) * 2.\n\n**Difficulty Level:** This question is designed to be accessible and easy to understand, allowing the student to gradually build their confidence and skills. It requires basic application of the formula, without any complex calculations or abstract thinking.\n\n**Immediate Feedback:** After submitting their answer, the student will receive feedback in the form of:\n\n* The correct answer\n* A brief explanation of the solution\n* An opportunity to review the formula and concept\n* A suggestion to practice more similar questions to reinforce their understanding\n\nThis initial question is designed to lay the foundation for the student's understanding of Linear Sequences (nth term) and help them regain their confidence in this area.",

    "content": "**Student's Last Answer Explanation:**\n\nThe student attempted to apply the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find the 9th term of a sequence that starts with 9 and increases by 4 each time. They correctly identified the first term \\(a_1 = 9\\) and the common difference \\(d = 4\\), and correctly set \\(n = 9\\). They correctly calculated:\n\n\\[\na_9 = 9 + (9-1)\\times4 = 9 + 8 \\times 4 = 9 + 32 = 41.\n\\]\n\nHowever, they expressed uncertainty and incorrectly added another \\(4\\) to the result, leading them to choose the incorrect answer option **D) 45**.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\nThe correct answer is indeed **C) 41**, as calculated:\n\n\\[\na_9 = 9 + (9-1)\\times4 = 9 + 8 \\times 4 = 9 + 32 = 41.\n\\]\n\nThe student's mistake was adding an extra \\(4\\), which is not necessary.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's difficulty with sequences that increase, let's introduce a new question that requires applying the formula in a slightly different context.\n\n**Question 5:**\n\nA sequence of numbers starts with 3 and increases by 5 each time. What is the 5th term of this sequence?\n\nA) 15\nB) 18\nC) 20\nD) 22\nE) 25\n\n**Reasoning Skill:** This question requires applying the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, where the sequence increases by a certain amount each time. You will need to apply the formula: an = a1 + (n - 1)d, where a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference. Since the sequence increases by 5 each time, d = 5. The first term, a1, is given as 3. You need to find the 5th term (n = 5), so you'll use the formula: a5 = 3 + (5 - 1) * 5.\n\n**Difficulty Level:** This question is designed to build on the student's understanding of the formula and encourage them to think about sequences that increase, rather than decrease. It requires basic application of the formula and a bit more attention to detail.\n\n**Immediate Feedback:** After submitting your answer, you will receive feedback in the form of:\n\n*   The correct answer\n*   A brief explanation of the solution\n*   An opportunity to review the formula and concept\n*   A suggestion to practice more similar questions to reinforce your understanding",
