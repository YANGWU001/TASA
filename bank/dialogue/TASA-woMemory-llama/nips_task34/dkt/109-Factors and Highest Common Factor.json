The highest common factor of 80 and 10 is actually 10, not 2.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's partial understanding of factors and HCF, let's try a question that requires them to apply this knowledge in a more structured way. Here's the next question:\n\n**Question 10:**\n\nA toy factory has 90 toys to pack, and they want to pack them in boxes of 15 toys each. How many boxes will they be able to fill, and what will be the highest common factor of the number of toys and the number of toys in each box?\n\n**Number of boxes:** _____________________________\n\n**Highest Common Factor (HCF) of the number of toys and the number of toys in each box:** _____________________________\n\nThis question will help the student apply their understanding of factors and HCF to a real-world scenario, making it more engaging and relevant.",
