    "content": "**Explanation of Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student attempted to calculate the perimeter of a right-angled triangle with a base of 6 meters and a height of 8 meters. They correctly identified the need to find the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem. They applied the theorem correctly, finding the square of the hypotenuse to be 100, which is indeed the square of 10. The student then correctly calculated the square root of 100, which is 10. However, they showed uncertainty about their answer, questioning if the hypotenuse could be a different number. To complete the problem, they correctly calculated the perimeter by adding the three sides: 6 + 8 + 10 = 24 meters. Despite their initial uncertainty, the student's final answer is actually correct, but they need to build more confidence in their calculations.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's profile and the previous questions, it seems that they need more practice with applying the perimeter formula to different types of shapes, including triangles, and specifically with the Pythagorean theorem. To help reinforce their understanding, let's try a question that involves a right-angled triangle with two known sides, and this time, we'll focus on building their confidence in their calculations.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA right-angled triangle has a base of 10 meters and a height of 12 meters.
