They also had difficulty applying the percentage calculation for the discount, resulting in an unclear and inaccurate final answer. This indicates a need for review of percentage calculations and the ability to apply them consistently in different contexts.\n\n**Next Question: Building on Student's Understanding**\n\nTo address the student's misconceptions and build on their understanding of percents, let's try a new question that requires them to apply their knowledge of percentages in a slightly different context.\n\n**Practice Question 8: Percent Problem with a Real-World Scenario**\n\n\"A local coffee shop sells 150 cups of coffee per day. If 30% of the coffee sold is decaf, and the coffee shop offers a 15% discount on all decaf coffee, how much discount is applied to the total number of decaf cups sold per day?\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n- This question still focuses on percents, but in a slightly different context, allowing the student to apply their understanding in a new scenario.\n- The calculation required (30% of 150 and then 15% of the result) is still manageable for the student, given their current level of mastery.\n- This question encourages the student to think about applying percentages in a real-world situation, which can help them develop a deeper understanding of the concept.\n\n**Expected answer:** 13.5 (30% of 150 = 45, 15% of 45 = 6.75, rounded to 7, but since we need the actual discount, it is 6.75, which is a discount of 6.75 dollars and 6.75 + 6.75 = 13.5, then 13.5 is the discount applied to the total number of decaf cups sold)",
