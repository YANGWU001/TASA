    "content": "**Explanation of the student's last answer:**\n\nYou're close, but the correct answer isn't **5/9**. You correctly multiplied the numerators (5 \u00d7 9) to get 45 and the denominators (6 \u00d7 10) to get 60, resulting in 45/60 as the product of 5/6 and 9/10. However, you can simplify this fraction further by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and 60. The GCD is 15. Dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 15 results in 3/4, which is the correct simplified form.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help you build on your understanding of fraction multiplication and simplification, let's try another question that's slightly more challenging but still within your comfort zone.
