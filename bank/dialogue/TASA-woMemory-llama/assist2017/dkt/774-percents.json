I might be mixing up the numbers, but I feel 35% sounds right.  \n\nSo I\u2019d pick **C) 35%**."

    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer**\n\nStudent, you're getting closer, but there's a slight calculation mistake. You correctly divided 18 by 60, which indeed gives you 0.3. However, multiplying 0.3 by 100 is correct, and you should arrive at 30%, not 35%. You correctly identified the calculation, but the result is a percentage of 30%, not 35%. To find the correct percentage, remember to multiply the decimal result by 100.\n\n**Next Question Tailored to the Student's Profile**\n\nLet's try another question that targets percents. Here it is:\n\nQuestion: 15 is what percent of 75?\n\nThis question is another simple percent question that requires the student to apply their knowledge of percents. It's a straightforward calculation that will allow the student to practice and reinforce their understanding of the concept.\n\nTo make it even more engaging and help the student learn from their mistakes, I will also provide a multiple-choice answer option with incorrect answers, such as:\n\nA) 18%\nB) 20%\nC) 22.5%\nD) 25%\n\nThis will allow the student to choose the correct answer and receive immediate feedback on their response.",
