The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is a fundamental property in geometry, and it's actually 180\u00b0, not 90\u00b0. The reasoning behind this is that when you draw a triangle, you can create two additional triangles by drawing lines from one vertex to the other two vertices.

The sum of the two angles at the base of the bridge (60\u00b0 and 80\u00b0) is 140\u00b0, not 140\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. To find the measure of the third angle, you should subtract the sum of the two known angles from 180\u00b0, which is the sum of the interior angles of a triangle. This is a straightforward application of the sum of interior angles property.\n\n**Correct Calculation:**\n\n180\u00b0 (sum of interior angles of a triangle) - 140\u00b0 (sum of the two known angles) = 40\u00b0\n\nThe third angle at the top of the bridge must be 40\u00b0, not 20\u00b0. This question requires you to apply the sum of interior angles property to a real-world scenario, and it's essential to remember that the sum of interior angles of a triangle is always 180\u00b0, regardless of the shape or size of the triangle.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nConsidering your understanding of the sum of interior angles and your need for further practice, I'd like to try a different approach to help you solidify your understanding.

The sum of interior angles of a triangle is determined by the angles, not the side lengths. The isosceles triangle in option B does not necessarily have equal sums of interior angles. \n\nTo determine the sum of interior angles of the isosceles triangle, we need to know the measure of its angles. Without this information, we cannot conclude that it has equal sums of interior angles compared to the other options.\n\n**Next Question**\n\nConsidering your understanding of the sum of interior angles and your need for further practice, I'd like to try a different approach to help you solidify your understanding.
