The student's recent performance indicates they need to practice solving problems with a moderate level of difficulty, so this question should challenge them but not overwhelm them.\n\n**Hint:** You can use the combination formula to solve this problem, or try to use a simpler approach by listing out the possible combinations and counting them.",

    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of combinations with repetitions by using the stars and bars formula. They correctly identified the number of distinct objects (n = 3) and the number of selections (k = 3). However, they initially arrived at the incorrect answer of 10 by using the formula \\(\\binom{5}{3}\\). Upon reevaluating their approach, they realized that the counts of each color (5 red, 3 blue, 2 green) don't limit the number of ways to choose 3 marbles with repetition. They correctly applied the formula for combinations with repetitions, \\(\\binom{n + k - 1}{k}\\), and arrived at the correct answer of \\(\\binom{12}{3} = 220\\). This is a significant improvement from their previous answer, demonstrating their ability to correct their approach and arrive at the correct solution.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's recent performance and the need for improvement, the next question should be slightly more challenging but still within their reach.
