The student initially correctly calculated that 25% is a quarter, and a quarter of 90 is \\(90 \u00f7 4 = 22.5\\). However, they mistakenly recalled that 20% of 90 is 18, which led them to choose the incorrect answer.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's incorrect answer, I'll create a question that builds upon their understanding of \"percent-of\" within equivalent-fractions-decimals-percents, but with a slight increase in difficulty.

They can multiply the percentage value (75) by the number (120) and then divide by 100 to get the result.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n- It builds upon the student's recent success with \"percent-of\" within equivalent-fractions-decimals-percents.\n- It requires a simple calculation, which is manageable for the student's current level of understanding.\n- The answer choices are straightforward and easy to distinguish from one another, reducing the likelihood of confusion.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- If the student answers correctly, it indicates they can apply the concept of \"percent-of\" to a slightly more challenging problem.\n- If the student answers incorrectly, it will provide an opportunity to review and reinforce the concept, and I can adjust the difficulty level for future practice questions accordingly.",
