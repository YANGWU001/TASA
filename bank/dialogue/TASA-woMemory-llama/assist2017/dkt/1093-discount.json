    "content": "Given the student's profile, I'll create a practice question that's easy enough to provide a chance for them to gain confidence, but not so easy that they might get discouraged. The goal is to get them to understand the concept of discount and build their knowledge.\n\n**Practice Question 1:**\n\nMaria bought a dress on sale for $120. The original price of the dress was $150. What percentage of the original price did Maria pay for the dress?\n\nA) 60%\nB) 80%\nC) 85%\nD) 90%\n\n**Reasoning Skill:** This question requires the student to apply the concept of discount by finding the percentage of the original price Maria paid. To solve this, the student needs to calculate the discount amount (150 - 120 = 30) and then find the percentage of the original price that Maria paid (120 / 150 = 0.8 or 80%).\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n- It's not too difficult, allowing the student to build confidence.\n- It requires the student to apply the concept of discount, which is the focus area for improvement.\n- It's a basic calculation, making it accessible for a student with moderate forgetting and low mastery of the concept.\n\nLet's see how the student performs on this question and adjust the difficulty level accordingly in subsequent questions.",

    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's answer, option C) 25%, is actually correct. They correctly calculated the discount amount ($240 - $192 = $48) and then found the percentage of the original price that is the discount amount by dividing the discount amount ($48) by the original price ($240), which gives 0.2 or 20%. However, the student mistakenly thought the result was 25%. This is a great sign that the student is making progress and understanding the concept of discount, but still needs a bit more practice to solidify their understanding.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's moderate forgetting and low mastery of the concept, the next question should be slightly more challenging but still accessible. Here's a question that builds on the previous one:\n\n**Practice Question 10:**\n\nA book was originally priced at $300. It's on sale for $210. What is the percentage of the original price that is the discount amount?\n\nA) 15%\nB) 18%\nC) 20%\nD) 22%\n\n**Reasoning Skill:** This question requires the student to apply the concept of discount by finding the discount amount (300 - 210 = 90) and then finding the percentage of the original price that is the discount (90 \u00f7 300 = 0.3 or 30%). This question is a bit more challenging than the previous ones, as it requires the student to find the percentage of the original price that is the discount, but it's still within the student's reach.",
