Here's a question that will help you practice recognizing the product of two single-digit numbers and their place value.\n\n**Question:** 4 \u00d7 8 = ?\n\n**Reasoning Skill:** This question requires the student to recall a basic multiplication fact and identify the correct product, understanding that the product of two numbers is found by adding the first number a number of times equal to the second number, while also considering the place value of the numbers.\n\n**Difficulty Level:** Easy, as it involves a simple multiplication fact that the student should be familiar with.\n\n**Answer Choices:** A) 28, B) 32, C) 36, D) 40\n\nThis question is designed to be a gentle review of a basic multiplication fact, allowing the student to regain their confidence and build a strong foundation for more complex problems, while also emphasizing the concept of place value in multiplication.",
