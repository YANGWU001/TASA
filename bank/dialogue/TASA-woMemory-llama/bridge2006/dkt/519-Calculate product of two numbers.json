The distractors (B, C, and D) are plausible but incorrect, allowing the student to practice their critical thinking and decision-making skills.\n\nThis question is designed to:\n\n1. Build on the student's existing knowledge and understanding of multiplication.\n2. Gradually increase the difficulty level by introducing more complex calculations.\n3. Provide opportunities for the student to practice and refine their multiplication skills.",
