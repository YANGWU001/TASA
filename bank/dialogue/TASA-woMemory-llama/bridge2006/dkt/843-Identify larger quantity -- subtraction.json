To create an engaging and challenging question, I'll design a problem that requires them to apply this concept.

    "content": "**Explanation of the student's last answer:**\n\nThe student is still struggling with the concept of identifying larger quantities through subtraction. In this question, they incorrectly compared the two subtraction operations, 85 - 49 and 49 - 85. They mentioned that subtracting 49 from 85 gives a negative number, and they think a negative number is \"bigger\" because it's farther away from zero. However, they are still comparing the results based on their signs, rather than their absolute values. The correct comparison should be based on the absolute values, not just the signs. Subtracting 49 from 85 indeed results in 36, which is larger than the result of subtracting 85 from 49, which is -36.\n\n**Next question:**\n\n**Question:** Which number is larger: 98 - 28 or 28 - 98?\n\n**A)** 98 - 28\n**B)** 28 - 98\n**C)** They are equal\n**D)** We can't compare them\n\n**Why this question:** This question requires the student to apply the concept of identifying larger quantities through subtraction to a different set of numbers. It also allows them to practice comparing the results of subtraction operations with different signs.\n\n**Expected answer:** A) 98 - 28\n\n**Why this answer is correct:** Subtracting 28 from 98 will result in 70, which is larger than the result of subtracting 98 from 28, which is -70.\n\nThis question will help the student to better understand that when subtracting a smaller number from a larger number, the result will always be larger than when subtracting a larger number from a smaller number.",
