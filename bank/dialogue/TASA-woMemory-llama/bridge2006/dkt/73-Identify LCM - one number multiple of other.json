    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student is starting to grasp the concept that when one number is a multiple of the other, the LCM is indeed the larger number. They correctly identified that 72 is the larger number and applied that understanding to arrive at the correct answer. However, they didn't explicitly state the reasoning behind their choice, which is that 72 is a multiple of 48. This indicates that the student still needs to develop a more solid understanding of the relationship between multiples and LCM.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo further reinforce the student's understanding, let's introduce a question that requires them to apply their knowledge of LCM in a more explicit way. This time, we'll use numbers with a larger difference between them to challenge their thinking and help them generalize their understanding.\n\n**Question 10:**\n\nFind the LCM of 18 and 54.\n\nA) 18\nB) 36\nC) 54\nD) 108\n\n**Explanation:** In this question, 54 is a multiple of 18 (54 = 3 * 18), so the LCM will be the larger number. To reinforce the concept, let's highlight the relationship between the numbers: 54 can be divided by 18, but 18 cannot be divided by 54 without leaving a remainder. This will help the student solidify their understanding of why the LCM is the larger number in such cases. Additionally, this question requires the student to consider the factor that makes 54 a multiple of 18, which is 3, to find the correct LCM.",
