Given their current level of proficiency and minimal forgetting, I'll create a question that's not too easy but still accessible.\n\n**Practice Question 1:**\n\n**Problem:** \n\nTom has been saving money for a new bike and has $120 in his piggy bank. Every week, he earns $5 for doing chores. If he already had $80 in the piggy bank, how much more money does he need to reach his goal of $150?\n\n**What is the amount of money Tom still needs?**\n\n**Answer Choices:**\n\nA) $10\nB) $20\nC) $30\nD) $40\n\nThis question requires the student to apply the concept of finding the difference between two values, which is a key aspect of \"Find X@@@ Simple\" with a positive slope. The problem is designed to be slightly challenging but not overwhelming, allowing the student to apply their existing knowledge and build confidence in their understanding.",

    "content": "**Student's Last Answer:**\n\nYour answer of $20 is a good attempt, but let's break it down to see if it's correct. Tom initially had $80 in his piggy bank and wants to reach a goal of $150. To find the amount he still needs, we need to subtract the amount he already has from the goal amount. \n\n$150 (goal) - $80 (already has) = $70\n\nHowever, Tom earns $5 per week for doing chores, which means he will have more money than $80 over time. To find the correct answer, we should consider the amount he still needs after considering his weekly earnings. Since he earns $5 per week, we can calculate the total amount he will have after reaching his goal of $150. \n\nLet's assume he earns $5 per week for 'x' number of weeks. To find the amount he needs to reach his goal, we can subtract the amount he already has ($80) and the amount he will earn from doing chores ($5x) from the goal amount ($150). \n\n$150 - $80 - $5x = ?\n\nWe can then solve for 'x' to find the number of weeks it will take him to reach his goal. However, we are asked to find the amount he still needs, not the number of weeks. Since the question asks for the amount of money he still needs to reach his goal, we need to reevaluate our approach.\n\nLet's re-examine the problem. Tom already has $80 and earns $5 per week. To find the amount he still needs, we should consider the difference between the goal amount ($150) and the amount he will have after some time. Since the question asks for the amount he still needs, we can set up an equation:\n\nLet 'x' be the number of weeks he earns $5 per week. Then, the total amount he will have is:\n\n$80 (already has) + $5x (weekly earnings)\n\nWe want to find the amount he still needs to reach $150, so we can set up the equation:\n\n$80 + $5x = $150\n\nTo solve for 'x', we subtract $80 from both sides:\n\n$5x = $70\n\nThen, we divide both sides by $5:\n\nx = $70 / $5\nx = 14\n\nThis means he will have earned $70 more than his initial $80 after 14 weeks. To find the amount he still needs, we subtract the total amount he will have ($80 + $70 = $150) from the goal amount ($150):\n\n$150 (goal) - $150 (total amount he will have) = $0\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense because it implies he already has the goal amount. Let's re-evaluate our approach.\n\nThe problem asks for the amount he still needs to reach his goal of $150. Since he earns $5 per week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take him to reach his goal and then find the amount he will have after that time. However, this approach is unnecessary because we can simply find the amount he still needs by subtracting the amount he already has from the goal amount and then adding the amount he will earn from doing chores.\n\nLet's try again:\n\n$150 (goal) - $80 (already has) = $70\n\nSince he earns $5 per week, he will have $70 + $5 more than his initial $80 after one week. However, we are not given the exact time frame for reaching his goal, so we should focus on the initial problem. To find the amount he still needs, we should consider the difference between the goal amount and the amount he already has, not the amount he will have after some time.\n\n$150 (goal) - $80 (already has) = $70\n\nThis means Tom still needs $70 to reach his goal of $150.\n\nYour initial answer of $20 is incorrect. The correct answer is $70.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo help you improve your understanding of \"Find X@@@ Simple\" with a focus on positive-slope problems, let's try another question.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nMaria has been saving money for a new video game and has $85 in her piggy bank. Every week, she earns $3 for doing chores. If she already had $60 in the piggy bank, how much more money does she need to reach her goal of $120?\n\n**What is the amount of money Maria still needs?**\n\n**Answer Choices:**\n\nA) $5\nB) $15\nC) $25\nD) $35",
