    "content": "**Student's Last Answer Explanation:**\n\nThe student has demonstrated a good understanding of the concept of multiplying two-digit numbers by correctly calculating that 24 baskets \u00d7 9 pastries/basket = 216 pastries. However, they were unable to select the exact answer from the options and chose the closest option, **B) 210**, as a result of a quick estimation. This shows that the student is making progress in understanding the concept, but may need to work on their calculation accuracy and ability to select the correct answer from the options.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConsidering the student's current understanding of multiplying two-digit numbers, the next question should be tailored to build on their confidence and accuracy. A suitable question would be:\n\n**Question:**\n\nA bookshelf has 27 books, and each book has 5 chapters. How many chapters are there in total?\n\n**Options:**\n\nA) 120\nB) 125\nC) 130\nD) 135\n\nThis question is designed to be slightly more challenging than the previous ones, but still accessible for the student to demonstrate their understanding of multiplying two-digit numbers. The student will need to accurately calculate the result and select the correct answer from the options.",
