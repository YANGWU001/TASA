They correctly identified the problem as a multiplication question and applied the concept of multiplication to find the total number of books that can be placed on all the sections. However, the student's calculation seems to be close, but not entirely accurate. To find the total number of books that can be placed on all the sections, the student should have simply multiplied 18 sections by 25 books per section. This would give the exact answer, 450 books, but the student's slight hesitation and uncertainty suggest that they may be struggling to maintain their multiplication skills, which is a concern given their severe knowledge loss in this area.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question:** \"A bookshelf has 20 shelves, and each shelf can hold 12 books.
