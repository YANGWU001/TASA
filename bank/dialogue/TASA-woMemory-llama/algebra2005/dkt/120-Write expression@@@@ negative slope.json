To identify the slope, the student correctly noticed that the line decreases by two units for each step to the right, which means the slope (m) is indeed -2.\n2.  To find the y-intercept (b), the student should look for the exact point where the line crosses the y-axis. From the graph, we can see that the line crosses the y-axis at a point above the origin, but the exact value is not specified.\n\nGiven the student's profile and the need for review, the next question will be a similar scenario with a slightly modified graph, requiring the student to apply their understanding of writing expressions with a negative slope.\n\n**Question 7:**\n\nThe graph shows a line with a negative slope. Write an expression for the line in the form y = mx + b.\n\n```\n  -12  -11  -10  -9  -8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1  0\n*-------------------------------------------*\n      -8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1\n```\n\n**Reasoning Skill:**\n\n* Identify the negative slope from the graph.\n* Write the slope (m) as a negative number.\n* Use the point (0, b) to find the y-intercept (b).\n* Write the complete expression in the form y = mx + b.\n\n**Hint:** Think about the change in the y-values as you move from left to right on the graph.\n\nPlease take your time, and try to write the correct expression for the line.",
