    "content": "Based on the student's profile, I've generated a practice question to help them improve their understanding of writing an expression for a negative slope.\n\n**Practice Question 1:**\n\n**Concept:** Writing an expression for a negative slope\n\n**Question:** The line passes through the points (-2, 4) and (1, 2). What is the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept?\n\n**Hint:** The slope is negative.\n\n**Additional Information:** Since the student has shown minimal forgetting, we'll provide a gentle review of the concept. The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\nTo find the slope, we can use the formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n\nPlugging in the given points: m = (2 - 4) / (1 - (-2)) = -2 / 3\n\nSince the slope is negative, we know that the line will have a negative slope. Now, let's find the y-intercept (b). We can use one of the given points, for example, (1, 2). Plugging in the values into the equation y = mx + b, we get:\n\n2 = (-2/3)(1) + b\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2 = -2/3 + b\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction, we get:\n\n6 = -2 + 3b\n\nAdding 2 to both sides, we get:\n\n8 = 3b\n\nDividing both sides by 3, we get:\n\nb = 8/3\n\nNow that we have the slope (m = -2/3) and the y-intercept (b = 8/3), we can write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form:\n\ny = (-2/3)x + 8/3\n\n**Answer:** y = (-2/3)x + 8/3\n\n**Explanation:** This question is designed to help the student recall the concept of writing an expression for a negative slope. By providing a gentle review of the concept and guiding them through the steps to find the slope and y-intercept, the student should be able to understand how to write an expression for a negative slope.",

    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student has correctly identified the slope as -2/3, which is a negative slope as hinted in the question. They have also started to find the y-intercept by plugging in the point (1, 2) into the equation y = mx + b, which is a great step. However, they seem to be struggling to isolate the y-intercept (b). Let's help them complete the solution.\n\n**Corrected Solution:**\n\nTo find the y-intercept (b), the student needs to isolate b on one side of the equation. They can do this by subtracting -2/3 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2 = -2/3 + b\n\nSubtracting -2/3 from both sides gives:\n\n2 + 2/3 = b\n\nTo add 2/3 to 2, the student can convert 2 to a fraction with a common denominator, which is 3:\n\n2 = 6/3\n\nNow, adding 2/3 to 6/3 gives:\n\n6/3 + 2/3 = 8/3\n\nSo, the y-intercept (b) is 8/3.\n\nThe equation of the line in slope-intercept form is:\n\ny = (-2/3)x + 8/3\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Practice Question 2:**\n\n**Concept:** Writing an expression for a negative slope\n\n**Question:** The line passes through the points (3, -2) and (-1, -6).

They correctly applied the slope formula, \\(m = \\dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\), to find the slope of the line passing through the points (3, 2) and (0, -3). Initially, they calculated the slope as \\(\\dfrac{5}{3}\\) but then recognized that it should be negative, which they corrected to \\(-\\dfrac{5}{3}\\). The student then used the point (0, -3) to find the y-intercept, correctly identifying it as -3 since x = 0. Their final answer, y = \\(-\\dfrac{5}{3}x - 3\\), demonstrates a solid understanding of writing expressions for a negative slope.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Practice Question 7:**\n\n**Concept:** Writing an expression for a negative slope\n\n**Question:** The line passes through the points (5, 4) and (2, 2). What is the equation of the line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept?\n\n**Hint:** Use the slope formula to find the slope and remember to consider its sign.\n\n**Additional Information:** Remember to use the formula m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) to find the slope, and then use one of the given points to find the y-intercept (b).\n\nThis question will help the student reinforce their understanding of finding a negative slope with a different set of points, which is essential for mastering this concept.",
