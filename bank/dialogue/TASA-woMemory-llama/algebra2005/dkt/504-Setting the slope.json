When the two points have the same x-coordinate, it means that the line is not moving left or right, and therefore, there is no change in the x-direction. As a result, the slope, which is the ratio of the change in y-coordinates to the change in x-coordinates, is 0.

The points (3, 2) and (6, 2) are horizontally aligned, and you can see that the line is moving to the right, which indicates a positive slope. By calculating the slope using the formula, you'll be able to confirm that the slope is indeed positive.",
