We also know that Tom has some amount of money, but we don't know how much. Let's call the amount of money Tom has \"y\" dollars. To find out how much more money Tom needs to buy the bike, we need to subtract the amount he has from the price of the bike: x - y.\n\n## Step 2: Understand the relationship between the variables\nWe need more information to solve the problem. Can you think of something we might know about the variables x and y?\n\n## Step 3: Provide a hint to the student\nLet's think about the information we have so far. We know that Tom's mom will have $50 left after she buys the toy. This means that the amount she has initially minus the price of the toy equals $50. We can represent this as: y - (price of the toy) = 50.\n\n## Step 4: Ask a question to help the student think critically\nWhat is the price of the toy?\n\n## Step 5: Provide a hint to the student\nWe can use the price of the toy to help us find the amount of money Tom has. Can you think of a way to represent the price of the toy as an equation?\n\n## Step 6: Ask a question to help the student think critically\nIf the toy costs $12, how much money does Tom's mom have initially?\n\n## Step 7: Provide a hint to the student\nWe can use the equation from Step 6 to find the value of y, which is the amount of money Tom has.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the initial amount of money Tom's mom has\nLet's assume the price of the toy is $12. We can write the equation as: y - 12 = 50. To solve for y, we can add 12 to both sides of the equation: y = 50 + 12. Using a calculator, we can compute this expression: 50 + 12 = 62 = 62.\n\n## Step 9: Provide feedback to the student\nSo, Tom's mom has $62 initially. Now we can use this information to find the price of the bike.\n\n## Step 10: Ask a question to help the student think critically\nIf Tom's mom has $62 initially and she buys a bike, how much money will she have left?\n\n## Step 11: Provide a hint to the student\nWe can use the information from Step 10 to set up an equation. Let's say the price of the bike is x. We know that Tom's mom will have $50 left after buying the bike, so we can write the equation as: 62 - x = 50.\n\n## Step 12: Calculate the price of the bike\nTo solve for x, we can add x to both sides of the equation: 62 = 50 + x. Then, we can subtract 50 from both sides: 12 = x.\n\n## Step 13: Provide feedback to the student\nThe price of the bike is $12. Now we can find out how much more money Tom needs to buy the bike.\n\n## Step 14: Calculate how much more money Tom needs\nWe know that Tom's mom has $62 initially and the bike costs $12. To find out how much more money Tom needs, we can subtract the price of the bike from the initial amount: 62 - 12.\n\n## Step 15: Calculate the final answer\nUsing a calculator, we can compute the expression: 62 - 12 = 50 = 50.\n\nThe final answer is: $50",

Write the equation to solve for how much more money Tom needs.\n\nAnswer: \nLet's use the variable x to represent the price of the book and y to represent Tom's current amount of money. We know that Tom has $120 and the book costs $60. The equation to find out how much more money Tom needs is:\n\nx - y = ?\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n60 - 120 = ?\n\nUsing a calculator to solve the equation:\n\n60 - 120 = -60\n\nThe answer is -60. However, the question asks how much more money Tom needs, which is the negative amount.
