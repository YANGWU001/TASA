He wants to wear a combination of 3 scarves to a music festival. However, he has a condition: he wants to make sure that his outfit includes at least one blue scarf, one green scarf, and one red scarf. How many different combinations of 3 scarves can Tom wear to the festival?\n\n**Hint:** You can use the concept of combinations and the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) to solve this problem.\n\n**What do you think the answer is?**\n\n(Note: I'll be happy to guide you through the solution and provide the answer using the calculator.)",
