If you buy the shirt, how much will you pay in total, including a 6% sales tax?\n\n**Your task:** Calculate the total amount you'll pay for the shirt, using the original price, discount, and sales tax.\n\nTake your time, and when you're ready, let me know your answer. I'll check it with my calculator: 45 * 0.15 = 6.75, 45 - 6.75 = 38.25, 38.25 * 0.06 = 2.295, 38.25 + 2.295 = 40.545 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]",

Convert 15% to a decimal: 15 / 100 = 0.15 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n2. Multiply 0.15 by $45: 0.15 * 45 = 6.75 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSo, the discount amount is $6.75.\n\nNow that we have the discount amount, we need to find the total amount we'll pay for the shirt.

The student mentioned a 20% discount, but the original problem was about finding the discount amount for a 15% discount on a $45 item.\n\nHowever, let's analyze the student's answer as it is. If we assume the student is talking about a 20% discount on the original price of $45, we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. Express 20% as a decimal by dividing by 100: 20 / 100 = 0.20 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n2. Multiply the decimal by the original price: 0.20 * 45 = 9 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n3. Subtract the discount from the original price: 45 - 9 = 36 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nHowever, the student's answer was that the cake would cost about $22 after the 20% discount, which is not correct based on the calculation above.\n\nTo find the correct answer, let's go back to the original problem: finding the discount amount for a 15% discount on a $45 item.\n\n1. Express 15% as a decimal by dividing by 100: 15 / 100 = 0.15 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n2. Multiply the decimal by the original price: 0.15 * 45 = 6.75 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n3.

The student mentioned that the discount would be 25% of $60, which is a different problem from the original one.\n2. To find 25% of $60, the student correctly expressed 25% as a decimal by dividing by 100: 25 / 100 = 0.25 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n3. Then, the student multiplied the decimal by the original price of $60: 0.25 \u00d7 60 = 15 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n4.

However, this calculation is related to a 25% discount on $60, not a 20% discount. Let's correct the calculation for a 20% discount on $75:\n\n1. The discount percentage is 20%, which can be represented as 0.20 in decimal form.\n2. The original price is $75.\n3. To find the discount amount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 0.20 \u00d7 75 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = $15\n4. Since the student correctly calculated the discount amount as $15, the next step is to subtract the discount from the original price to find the final price Tom would pay: 75 - 15 = 60 = $60\n\nHowever, the student incorrectly stated that Tom would pay around $65 for the shirt. Based on the correct calculation, the final price should be $60, not $65.\n\nEducational feedback: The student showed a good understanding of how to calculate a discount, but made an error in applying the correct discount percentage to the original price.

However, this is a miscalculation because the original price was $75, not $80.\n\nThe student's correct approach should have been to find the discount amount as a percentage of the original price, $75.
