      "content": "**Student's Answer Explanation:**\n\nThe student's answer is mostly correct. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. The garden's original length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters. The path is 2 meters wide, so it adds 2 meters to each side.\n2. The new length is indeed 15 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] meters.\n3. Similarly, the new width is 8 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] meters.\n4. The student correctly recognizes that the path adds 2 meters to each side, so the new perimeter is the sum of the new length and width multiplied by 2. The student calculates this as 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 2 \u00d7 17 + 10 = 27 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] meters.\n\nHowever, the student could have simplified the calculation by first finding the sum of the new length and width, and then multiplying by 2: 2 \u00d7 (17 + 10) = 2 \u00d7 17 + 10 = 27 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] meters. Alternatively, the student could have calculated the perimeter directly by adding 4 times the width of the path to the original perimeter: 2(15 + 8) + 4(2) = 2(23) + 8 = 2 \u00d7 23 = 46 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] + 8 = 54 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] meters.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nA rectangular picture frame has an outer perimeter of 72 meters and a width of 3 meters. If the frame is 1 meter wide, what is the length of the picture inside the frame?\n\n(Note: The length of the picture is unknown, but you can use the information given to find it.)",

      "content": "**Student's Answer Explanation:**\n\n1. The garden's original length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters. The path is 2 meters wide and is built around the garden. To find the new length, we add 2 meters to each side of the original length: 15 + 2 + 2 = 19 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] meters.\n2. Similarly, to find the new width, we add 2 meters to each side of the original width: 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] meters.\n3. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding all the sides together: 2 * (new length + new width) = 2 * (19 + 12) = 2 * 31 = 62 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] meters.\n\nThe student was correct in adding 2 meters to each side, but made a small mistake in the final calculation.

The garden's original length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters. The path is 2 meters wide and is built around the garden. To find the new length, we add 2 meters to both sides of the original length:\n   15 + 2 + 2 = 19 = 19 meters\n   The new length is 19 meters.\n\n2. Similarly, we add 2 meters to both sides of the original width:\n   8 + 2 + 2 = 12 = 12 meters\n   The new width is 12 meters.\n\n3.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step to find the correct answer.\n\n1. The garden's original length is 15 meters and the width is 8 meters. The path is 2 meters wide and is built around the garden.\n2. To find the new length, we add 2 meters (the width of the path) to both the length and the width of the garden. The new length is 15 + 2 + 2 = 19 meters.\n3. The new width is 8 + 2 + 2 = 12 meters.\n4. Now, we need to find the perimeter of the new garden. The perimeter is the sum of all sides, which is 2 \u00d7 (new length) + 2 \u00d7 (new width).\n5. Substitute the values: 2 \u00d7 (19) + 2 \u00d7 (12) = 38 + 24 = 62 meters.\n\nThe student's mistake was in assuming the unit of measurement was inches, which was not mentioned in the problem. The correct unit is meters. The student also incorrectly calculated the perimeter by multiplying 7 inches by 4, which is a calculation for the perimeter of a square with side length 7 inches, not the perimeter of the garden.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nA rectangular swimming pool is 20 meters long and 5 meters wide.
