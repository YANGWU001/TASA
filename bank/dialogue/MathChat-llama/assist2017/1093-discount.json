However, she also gets an additional 5% discount on the reduced price. What is the final price Sarah paid for the TV?\n\n**Hint:** You can use the formula: Final Price = Original Price - (Discount 1 + Discount 2)\n\n**Let's calculate the answer:**\n\n1. First, find the amount of the first discount: 15% of $850 = 0.15 * 850 = 127.5\n2. Next, subtract the first discount from the original price: $850 - 0.15 * 850 = 127.5\n3. Now, find the amount of the second discount (5% of the reduced price): 5% of $850 - 0.15 * 850 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] = 0.05 * ($850 - 0.15 * 850) = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n4. Finally, subtract the second discount from the reduced price: $850 - 0.15 * 850 - 0.05 * ($850 - 0.15 * 850) = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\n**Can you calculate the final price Sarah paid for the TV?**",

      "content": "Student's answer is \"I don't know.\" This is a normal response when a student is unsure about the solution to a problem. Let's break down the solution step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1:** First, we need to find the discount amount. The original price of the TV is $850, and there is a 15% discount.\n\n850 * 0.15 = 127.50 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSo, the discount amount is $127.50.\n\n**Step 2:** Next, we subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the discounted price.\n\n850 - 127.50 = 722.50 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nNow, we have the discounted price, which is $722.50.\n\n**Step 3:** However, Sarah also gets an additional 5% off the discounted price. To find this discount, we multiply the discounted price by 0.05.\n\n722.50 * 0.05 = 36.125 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\n**Step 4:** Finally, we subtract this additional discount from the discounted price to get the final price.\n\n722.50 - 36.125 = 686.375 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSo, the final price Sarah pays for the TV is approximately $686.38.\n\nNow, let's move on to the next question.\n\n**Problem:** \n\nA bookstore is offering a discount of 20% off all books priced above $25. If a book originally costs $40, what is the discounted price?\n\nWhat is your answer?",

To find the discount amount, we'll multiply the original price by the discount percentage.\n\n850 * 0.15 = 127.5 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSo, the discount amount is $127.50.\n\n**Step 2:** Now, we need to subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the new price after the first discount.\n\n850 - 127.5 = 722.5 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nThe new price after the first discount is $722.50.\n\n**Step 3:** Next, we have an additional 5% discount on the new price. To find the discount amount, we'll multiply the new price by the additional discount percentage.\n\n722.5 * 0.05 = 36.125 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSo, the additional discount amount is $36.13.\n\n**Step 4:** Finally, we subtract the additional discount amount from the new price to find the final price after both discounts.\n\n722.5 - 36.13 = 686.37 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nThe final price after both discounts is approximately $686.37.\n\nNow, let's see how close your initial answer was. You thought the discount would bring the price down to about $30, which is a significant underestimation.\n\nThe final price after both discounts is $686.37, not $30.\n\n**Educational feedback:** It's essential to break down the problem step-by-step and calculate each discount separately. The key is to multiply the original price by the discount percentage to find the discount amount and then subtract it from the original price. We can apply the same process for each discount.\n\n**Next question:**\n\nA shirt originally costs $45. There's a 20% discount, and then an additional 10% discount on the new price.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1:** First, we need to find the original price. The student initially said the original price was about $30. However, the student then mentioned the original price being about $25, which seems to be a more accurate guess. Let's use this value for the original price.\n\n**Step 2:** To find the discount amount, we need to multiply the original price by the discount percentage (20% in this case).
