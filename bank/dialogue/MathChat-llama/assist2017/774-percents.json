The total distance between the two cities is 240 miles. Gas costs $2.50 per gallon, and her car's fuel efficiency is 30 miles per gallon. If Maria wants to have at least 20% of the total distance covered by gas, how many gallons of gas will she need?\n\n**Your task:** Use percents to find out how many gallons Maria needs.\n\nTo start, let's find out the total distance Maria wants to cover with gas:\n\n240 * 0.20 = 48.0 = 48 miles\n\nSo, Maria wants to cover at least 48 miles with gas.",

      "content": "Let's break down the student's answer with step-by-step reasoning.\n\n**Student's Answer:**\nMaria needs about 8 gallons of gas.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\n1. To find the amount of gas needed, we need to know the distance Maria wants to cover and her car's miles per gallon (mpg).\n2. The distance Maria wants to cover is 48 miles.\n3. Her car does about 30 miles per gallon.\n4. To find the amount of gas needed, we can divide the distance by the car's mpg: 48 \u00f7 30 = 1.6 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n5. However, the student said they got roughly 8 gallons, which is incorrect. Let's discuss why.\n   - The student might have made a mistake in their calculation or assumed a different calculation.\n   - The correct calculation is 48 \u00f7 30 = 1.6, which means Maria needs approximately 1.6 gallons of gas, not 8 gallons.\n\n**Educational Feedback:**\nIt's great that you tried to use the formula to find the amount of gas needed! However, let's review the calculation: dividing 48 miles by 30 miles per gallon will give you 1.6 gallons, not 8 gallons. Remember to double-check your calculations and consider the context of the problem.\n\n**Next Question:**\nMaria's car uses regular gas, which costs $2.50 per gallon. How much will it cost her to fill up her car with 1.6 gallons of gas?",

To find the amount of gas needed, we need to divide the total distance by the car's mileage per gallon.\n   48 miles / 30 miles/gallon = 1.6 gallons = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\n2. To find the cost of gas, we need to multiply the amount of gas needed by the cost per gallon. However, we don't have the cost per gallon yet.\n\n3. We can assume a typical cost per gallon of gas, for example, let's say it's $3.00 per gallon. However, since the student provided a specific answer, let's break it down to see if it matches.\n   1.6 gallons * $3.00/gallon = $4.80 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\n4. Since the student's answer was $5.00, it seems there might be a slight discrepancy. The correct calculation using the given information is $4.80, not $5.00.\n\n**Educational Feedback:**\nThe student's answer was close, but not quite accurate. The correct calculation shows that Maria would need approximately $4.80 to fill up with 1.6 gallons of gas. It's essential to double-check calculations and ensure accuracy, especially when working with real-world applications.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nEmily is planning a road trip from City A to City B.

The correct answer is $8.00.\n\n**Educational Feedback:**\nGreat job trying to solve the problem! You're on the right track by dividing the total distance by the car's mileage per gallon to find the amount of gas needed. However, for the second step, you mentioned a cost per gallon of $5.00 and estimated $20.00 for the gas. Let's break it down further: if the cost per gallon is $5.00, and you need 1.6 gallons, the total cost would be 1.6 * $5.00 = $8.00. Remember to always check your calculations and be precise!\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nMaria's friend, Alex, has a different car that gets 25 miles per gallon.

To find the amount of gas needed, we need to divide the total distance by the car's mileage per gallon.\n   The total distance is not given in the problem, so let's assume it is **x** miles.\n   The car's mileage per gallon is 30 miles/gallon.\n   We can write the formula as: x / 30 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n   \n2.

To find the amount of gas needed for Maria, we need to plug in the correct value of x into the equation and solve for the result.\n   Since the problem doesn't provide the value of x, we cannot calculate the exact amount of gas needed.\n\n**Educational Feedback:**\nThe student's answer is incorrect because it doesn't take into account the unknown value of the total distance (x).
