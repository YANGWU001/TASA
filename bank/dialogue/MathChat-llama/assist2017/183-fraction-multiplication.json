If she gives Emily 2/3 of her pizza, how much pizza will Sarah have left?\n\nTo solve this problem, you'll need to multiply the fractions 1/4 and 2/3. Can you use your knowledge of fraction-multiplication to find the answer?\n\n**Hint:** You can use the formula:\n\n(a/b) \u00d7 (c/d) = (a \u00d7 c) / (b \u00d7 d)\n\nWhere a, b, c, and d are the numerators and denominators of the fractions.\n\nWhat's your answer?",

Multiply the numerators (the numbers on top): \n1 x 2 = 2 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n2. Multiply the denominators (the numbers on the bottom): \n4 x 3 = 12 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n3. Write the product of the numerators over the product of the denominators: \n\\[\n\\frac{2}{12}\n\\]\n4. Simplify the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2 and 12, which is 2. Divide both the numerator and denominator by the GCD:\n2 \u00f7 2 = 1 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef] and 12 \u00f7 2 = 6 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\nSo, the simplified fraction is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Sarah gives Emily 1/6 = 0.16666666666666666 of her pizza.\n\nNext question: \n\nTom has a bag of apples containing 3/5 of a bag that he wants to sell at the store.
