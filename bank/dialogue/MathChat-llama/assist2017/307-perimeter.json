      "content": "**Step 1: Explanation of the student's answer**\n\nThe student's answer, \"I think the total cost would be about $45,\" indicates a guess rather than a calculated result. To find the total cost, the student needs to understand how to calculate the perimeter and multiply it by the price per meter of fencing.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Perimeter**: For a rectangle, the perimeter is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. If the garden is 5 meters long and 3 meters wide, the perimeter would be:\n   \\[\n   P = 2l + 2w\n   \\]\n   where l is the length and w is the width.\n   \\[\n   P = 2(5) + 2(3)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P = 10 + 6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   P = 16\n   \\]\n2. **Total Cost**: To find the total cost, we multiply the perimeter by the price per meter of fencing.
