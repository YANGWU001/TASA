Let's break it down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the problem**\nWe are given an arithmetic sequence with a first term (a) of 3 and a common difference (d) of 2. We need to find the 8th term of this sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence**\nThe formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is: a_n = a + (n-1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.\n\n**Step 3: Plug in the values**\nWe know a = 3, d = 2, and n = 8. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\na_8 = 3 + (8-1)2\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the expression**\nFirst, calculate the value inside the parentheses: 8-1 = 7\nThen, multiply the result by the common difference: 7 * 2 = 14\nFinally, add the result to the first term: 3 + 14 = 17\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the 8th term**\nUsing a calculator: 3 + (8-1) * 2 = 17 = 3 + 14 = 17 = 17\n\nThe 8th term of the sequence is 17.\n\n**Educational feedback**\nGreat job trying! It's okay to not know the answer at first. Remember, the key is to break down the problem into smaller steps and use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence.
