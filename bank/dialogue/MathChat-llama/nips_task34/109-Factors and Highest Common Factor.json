The correct answer is not 12, and it seems like the student mixed up the numbers. The student mentioned 18 and 24, but the question was about finding the HCF of 48 and 60.\n\nTo find the HCF of 48 and 60, we need to list the factors of each number. Factors are numbers that divide the given number without leaving a remainder.\n\n**Factors of 48:**\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48)\n\n**Factors of 60:**\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60)\n\nNow, let's find the common factors of 48 and 60 by comparing the two lists.

To find the factors, we can use the following steps:\n   - Start with the number 18: \n     - 18 \u00f7 1 = 18\n     - 18 \u00f7 2 = 9\n     - 18 \u00f7 3 = 6\n     - 18 \u00f7 6 = 3\n     - 18 \u00f7 9 = 2 (no further division possible)\n     - Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\n   - Next, let's find the factors of 24:\n     - 24 \u00f7 1 = 24\n     - 24 \u00f7 2 = 12\n     - 24 \u00f7 3 = 8\n     - 24 \u00f7 4 = 6\n     - 24 \u00f7 6 = 4\n     - 24 \u00f7 8 = 3\n     - 24 \u00f7 12 = 2\n     - 24 \u00f7 24 = 1\n     - Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\n\n2.

We can find these factors by dividing 48 by integers starting from 2: 48 \u00f7 1 = 48 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef], 48 \u00f7 2 = 24 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef], 48 \u00f7 3 = 16 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef], 48 \u00f7 4 = 12 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef], 48 \u00f7 6 = 8 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef], 48 \u00f7 8 = 6 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef], 48 \u00f7 12 = 4 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef], 48 \u00f7 16 = 3 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef], 48 \u00f7 24 = 2 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef], 48 \u00f7 48 = 1 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef].\n- Factors of 60 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.

Next, we need to identify the common factors of 48 and 60. The common factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n3. Finally, we need to find the highest common factor (HCF) by selecting the largest common factor. The HCF of 48 and 60 is 12.\n\nHowever, the student's answer is 24, which is not the correct answer.
