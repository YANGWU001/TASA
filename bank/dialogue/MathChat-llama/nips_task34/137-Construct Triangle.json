Find the length of the other leg (the height) using the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\n**Your Answer:**\nI don't know\n\n**Let's break it down step by step:**\n\n1.  The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This can be expressed as: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the two legs, and 'c' is the length of the hypotenuse.\n2.  In our problem, we know the length of the hypotenuse (c = 10 cm) and one leg (let's say 'a' = 6 cm). We need to find the length of the other leg (let's say 'b').\n3.  Plug in the values we know into the Pythagorean Theorem equation: a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n   6^2 + b^2 = 10^2 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n   This simplifies to: 36 + b^2 = 100\n4.  Now, let's isolate b^2 by subtracting 36 from both sides: b^2 = 100 - 36\n   b^2 = 64 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n5.  Finally, take the square root of both sides to find the value of 'b': b = sqrt(b^2) = sqrt(64)\n   b = 8 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nTherefore, the length of the other leg (the height) is 8 cm.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nConstruct a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of length 12 cm and one leg (the base) of length 9 cm.
