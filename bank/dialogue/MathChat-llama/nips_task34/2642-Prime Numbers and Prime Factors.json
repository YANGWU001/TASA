If 462 can be represented as the product of two prime numbers, can you find those prime numbers and show the prime factorization of 462?\n\n**Hint:** Use the method of prime factorization to break down 462 into its prime factors.\n\n**Task:** Use the prime factorization method to find the prime factors of 462.\n\n**Additional Information:** \n\nA prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nLet's calculate the prime factors of 462. \n\nTo do this, we need to find the prime numbers that divide 462 without leaving a remainder. \n\nLet's start by dividing 462 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. \n\n462 \u00f7 2 = 231 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nNext, we'll divide 231 by the smallest prime number that can divide 231, which is 3.\n\n231 \u00f7 3 = 77 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nNow, we'll divide 77 by the smallest prime number that can divide 77, which is 7.\n\n77 \u00f7 7 = 11 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nNow we have the prime factorization of 462: 462 = 2 * 3 * 7 * 11.\n\nTherefore, the prime factors of 462 are 2, 3, 7, and 11.",

So, we continue to break down 231.\n\nStep 2: Since 231 is not divisible by 2, let's try the next smallest prime number, which is 3.\n231 \u00f7 3 = 77 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nStill not a prime number. Let's continue.\n\nStep 3: Now, we try the next smallest prime number, which is 5.\n231 \u00f7 5 = 46.2 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSince 46.2 is not a whole number, 5 is not a factor of 231. We continue to the next prime number.\n\nStep 4: The next smallest prime number is 7.\n231 \u00f7 7 = 33 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nStill not a prime number. Let's continue.\n\nStep 5: The next smallest prime number is 11.\n231 \u00f7 11 = 21 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nNow we're making progress. Since 21 is not a prime number, let's continue.\n\nStep 6: The next smallest prime number is 13.\n231 \u00f7 13 = 17.769 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSince 17.769 is not a whole number, 13 is not a factor of 231. We continue to the next prime number.\n\nStep 7: The next smallest prime number is 17.\n231 \u00f7 17 = 13.588 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSince 13.588 is not a whole number, 17 is not a factor of 231.

We continue to the next prime number.\n\nStep 9: The next smallest prime number is 23.\n231 \u00f7 23 = 10.043 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSince 10.043 is not a whole number, 23 is not a factor of 231.

We continue to the next prime number.\n\nStep 13: The next smallest prime number is 41.\n231 \u00f7 41 = 5.634 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSince 5.634 is not a whole number, 41 is not a factor of 231. We continue to the next prime number.\n\nStep 14: The next smallest prime number is 43.\n231 \u00f7 43 = 5.372 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSince 5.372 is not a whole number, 43 is not a factor of 231.
