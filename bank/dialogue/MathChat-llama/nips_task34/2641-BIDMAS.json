To understand why they might have gotten 28, we need to see the expression they were trying to evaluate.\n\nSince the student didn't provide the expression, I'll create a simple example to demonstrate BIDMAS. Let's use the expression: 2 \u00d7 (3 + 4)\u00b2.\n\nTo evaluate this expression using BIDMAS, we follow the order of operations:\n\n1. Evaluate the expression inside the **B**rackets (or parentheses):\n   3 + 4 = 7\n   The result is 7.\n\n2. Next, we evaluate the **I**ndices (or exponents):\n   7\u00b2 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n   The result is 49.\n\n3. Finally, we multiply 2 by the result:\n   2 \u00d7 49 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n   The result is 98.\n\nHowever, the student's answer was 28, which suggests that the expression they were working with might be 2 \u00d7 (3 + 4) = 14, but they forgot to square the result. Let's assume the correct expression is 2 \u00d7 (3 + 4) = 14, then 14\u00b2 = 196.\n\nAnother possibility is that the student squared the 3 and 4 first, resulting in 9 and 16, then multiplied 2 by 25 (9 + 16), resulting in 50, which is not 28, so we can rule that out.",
