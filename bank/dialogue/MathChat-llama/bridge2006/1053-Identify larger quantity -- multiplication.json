The student correctly identified that Tom has 3 groups of 6 pencils: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n2. The student correctly identified that Sarah has 2 groups of 9 pencils: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n3. The student incorrectly compared the number of pencils, stating that David has more crayons because 28 is bigger than 35, when in fact, David's number of pencils is actually less than Sarah's.\n\n**Correct Answer:**\nTo find out who has more pencils in total, we need to calculate the total number of pencils each person has.\nTom has 3 groups of 6 pencils: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\nSarah has 2 groups of 9 pencils: 2 \u00d7 9 = 18 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\nSince both Tom and Sarah have the same number of pencils (18), we can conclude that they have an equal number of pencils.\n\n**Next Question:**\nLet's try another question.

They initially stated that they thought the correct operation was multiplication, but then incorrectly added 8 and 5 instead of multiplying them. This suggests that the student has a basic understanding of multiplication but struggles to apply it correctly in a given context.\n\n**Correct Solution:**\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n* The problem states that each batch has 8 cookies.\n* They make 5 batches.\n* To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of cookies in each batch by the number of batches: 8 \u00d7 5 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n* This equals 40 cookies.\n\n**Educational Feedback:**\n\nYou're on the right track by recognizing that multiplication is the correct operation to use in this problem. However, it's essential to apply the operation correctly. In this case, we need to multiply the number of cookies in each batch by the number of batches, not add them.

The student started correctly by identifying the original price of the book as $150.\n2. However, they then got sidetracked and incorrectly applied the discount to a different item, resulting in an incorrect calculation.\n3. To calculate the discount, we need to find 15% of the original price. This can be done by multiplying the original price by 0.15 (since 15% is equivalent to 0.15).\n   150 * 0.15 = 22.50 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n4. However, this is not the final step. The student needs to subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price.\n   150 - 22.50 = 127.50 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nThe correct answer is **A**, which is $127.50.\n\n**Educational Feedback:**\n\nThe student showed an understanding of the concept of discount but got sidetracked during the calculation.
