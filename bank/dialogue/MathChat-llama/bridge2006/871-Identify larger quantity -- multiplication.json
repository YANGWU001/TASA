To find the total number of pencils Mr. Thompson has, we multiply the number of groups by the number of pencils in each group. However, the student incorrectly assumed Mr. Thompson has 15 pencils in each group, which is not given in the problem. Let's assume Mr. Thompson has 2 groups of 12 pencils each, like Mrs. Johnson:\n   2 \u00d7 12 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n   = 24\n\nSince both Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Thompson have 24 pencils, the student's initial assumption that Mr. Thompson has more pencils is incorrect.\n\n**Educational Feedback:**\n\nThe student correctly multiplied the numbers, but there was a mistake in understanding the problem. The student should have multiplied the number of groups by the correct number of pencils in each group for Mr. Thompson. This highlights the importance of carefully reading and understanding the problem before solving it.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nQuestion: Mr. Brown has 5 boxes of crayons, and each box has 18 crayons in it.

To find the total number of pencils Mr. Thompson has, we multiply the number of groups by the number of pencils in each group:\n   2 \u00d7 15 = <2 \u00d7 15 = 30>\n\nMr. Thompson has 30 pencils.\n\n3. To compare the number of pencils Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Thompson have, we compare the results:\n   Mrs. Johnson has 36 pencils and Mr. Thompson has 30 pencils.\n   Since 36 is greater than 30, Mrs. Johnson has more pencils than Mr. Thompson.\n\nHowever, the student didn't complete the task and didn't compare the number of pencils between Mrs. Johnson and Mr. Thompson. The student also didn't calculate Mr. Thompson's pencils correctly, which would be 2 \u00d7 12 = <2 \u00d7 12 = 24> (not 2 \u00d7 15).\n\n**Educational Feedback:**\nThe student attempted to compare the number of pencils between groups but didn't complete the task and made a calculation error.

You correctly calculated Mr. Lee's crayons as 5 \u00d7 9 = 45, which is more than Mrs. Lee's 4 \u00d7 8 = 32.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nMrs. Patel has 5 boxes of markers, and each box contains 18 markers.

Remember to double-check your work, especially when multiplying numbers. You also got sidetracked by comparing the number of crayons, but we were actually finding the number of pencils for Mrs. Johnson. \n\n**Next Question:**\nFind the total number of books on the shelves if there are 4 shelves with 6 books on each shelf:\n4 \u00d7 6 = ?",
