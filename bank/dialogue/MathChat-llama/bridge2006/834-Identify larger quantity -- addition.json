Her friend, Emma, gives her 7 more pencils as a gift. Then, Maria finds 8 more pencils in her desk drawer. How many pencils does Maria have now?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to add the number of pencils Maria already had (15) to the number of pencils she received from her friend (7) and the number of pencils she found in her desk drawer (8).\n\nLet's use our calculator to find the answer:\n\n15 + 7 + 8 = ? = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nCan you think about it and try to solve it on your own before looking at the answer?",

To find out how many pencils Maria has now, we need to add the initial number of pencils and the number of pencils Emma gave her.\n\nFirst, we add the initial number of pencils: 15 + 0 = 15 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\nThen, we add the number of pencils Emma gave her: 15 + 7 = 22 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n\nSo, Maria now has 22 = 22 pencils in her pencil case.\n\nThe student's answer, <b>31</b>, is incorrect. The correct answer is <b>22</b> pencils.\n\nLet's try another question:\n\n**Identify Larger Quantity: Addition Practice Question 2**\n\nTom has 8 crayons in his box.
