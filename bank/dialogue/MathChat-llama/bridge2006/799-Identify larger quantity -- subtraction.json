The student's answer is 378 - 219 = 158.\n\nHere's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. We need to subtract 219 from 378.\n2. To do this, we can use the calculator: 378 - 219 = ? = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n3. The result of the calculation is: 378 - 219 = 159 = [\u8ba1\u7b97\u9519\u8bef]\n4. So, the difference between the number of pencils Sarah and Emma have is 159 pencils.\n\nIt seems the student made a small mistake. The correct answer is 159, not 158.\n\nHere's a new question for you:\n\n**Question:** Alex has 945 books in his bookshelf and his brother, Jack, has 627 books in his bookshelf.

Let's assume this is the number of pencils Sarah has.\n\nStep 2: Identify the number of pencils Emma has.\nUnfortunately, the student didn't mention the number of pencils Emma has. We need to find that out.\n\nHowever, since the student's goal is to find the difference between the number of pencils Sarah and Emma have, we need to know both numbers. Let's assume the number of pencils Emma has is x.\n\nStep 3: Subtract the smaller number (Emma's pencils) from the larger number (Sarah's pencils).\nThe expression for this would be: Sarah's pencils - Emma's pencils = 12 - x\n\nSince the student's goal is to find the difference, let's calculate the difference between 12 and x. However, we don't know the value of x yet.\n\nTo find the difference, we need more information about Emma's pencils.\n\nThe student's answer of 5 boxes is likely incorrect because it doesn't take into account the number of pencils Sarah has. The difference between the number of pencils Sarah and Emma have would be a number that depends on the value of x.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we need more information about Emma's pencils. \n\nHere's a question to help the student understand this concept better:\n\nQuestion: Let's say Emma has 7 pencils. How many pencils does Sarah have if the difference between the number of pencils Sarah and Emma have is 5?",

However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume Sarah has 12 pencils.\n\nStep 2: Identify the number of pencils Emma has.\nWe still don't know the number of pencils Emma has.

Since we know Sarah has about 12 pencils, we can use this information to find out how many pencils Emma has.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the difference between the number of pencils Sarah and Emma have.\nLet's represent the number of pencils Emma has as x. The difference between the number of pencils Sarah and Emma have is 12 - x.\n\nHowever, we don't know the exact value of x yet. Since we are trying to find the difference, we can represent this as an equation: 12 - x.\n\nTo find the value of x, we need more information about the problem. Unfortunately, the student didn't provide any information about Emma's pencils, so we can't calculate the exact difference.\n\nEducational feedback: To find the difference between the number of pencils Sarah and Emma have, we need to know the number of pencils Emma has.\n\nNext question: If Sarah has 15 pencils and Emma has an unknown number of pencils, what is the equation to find the difference between the number of pencils Sarah and Emma have?",
