Imagine a long line with numbers marked on it, starting from negative infinity on the left and positive infinity on the right.\n\nHere's your first question:\n\n**Interactive Question 1:**\n\"Imagine you are standing on a number line with 0 in the middle. If you move 3 steps to the left, where will you be?\"\n\nA) You'll be at -3\nB) You'll be at 0\nC) You'll be at 1\nD) You'll be at 3\n\nChoose your answer, and I'll guide you through the concept of negative integers and help you understand it better.\n\n(Remember, I'm here to help you learn at your own pace, so don't worry if you need more time or clarification on any concept!)",

Let's break down your answer and see how it aligns with the concept of a negative integer.\n\n**Your answer: A) You'll be at -3.**\n\nThat's close, but let me provide some feedback to help clarify the concept. When we're dealing with negative integers on a number line, we're essentially moving to the left of the zero mark. Imagine you're standing at 0 on the number line, and you want to move 3 units to the left. Where would you be?\n\nYou said you'd be at -3, which is correct! However, I want to reinforce the idea that moving to the left of the zero mark means we're dealing with negative numbers. Think of it like this: if you're at 0 and move 3 units to the left, you're essentially \"going into debt\" or moving into the negative territory. So, the correct answer is indeed -3.\n\nNow, let's try another question that's similar, but with a slight twist. Imagine you're at 5 on the number line, and you want to move 4 units to the left. Where would you end up?\n\nA) You'll be at 1\nB) You'll be at -1\nC) You'll be at -3\nD) You'll be at -4\n\nChoose your answer, and let's see how you do!",

Let's think about it together. If we start at 0 on the number line and move 3 units to the left, where would we be? Think about it like moving 3 blocks to the left on a number line. Where would you end up?\n\nTo help you visualize, let's use a simple example:\n\n0, -1, -2, -3\n\nSee how each number is 1 unit to the left of the previous one? If we start at 0 and move 3 units to the left, we'll be at -3.\n\n**Next Question:** Let's try another one. Imagine you're on a number line at -2.

We're starting at -2, and we need to subtract 4 units. Imagine moving 4 units to the left on the number line. Since we're moving left, we're moving towards more negative numbers.\n\nThink about it like this: if you're at -2 and you move 4 units to the left, you'll pass -3, then -4, then -5, and finally, you'll land at -6. So, your initial answer was correct, and I'm proud of you for persisting. Well done!\n\n**Next Question:** \n\nLet's try another one.

That's a great visual way to understand the concept of moving units on the number line. Your answer is almost there, but let's break it down. If you subtract 4 from -2, you're essentially moving 4 units to the left on the number line. Since -2 is already to the left, subtracting 4 more will take you even further left. Can you count how many units you'll move to the left in total?\n\nLet's count together: You start at -2, and if you subtract 4, you'll move 4 units to the left. That makes -2 - 4 = -6. You're correct that you end up at -6!\n\nHere's another question that uses a similar concept:\n\nImagine you're standing at -5 on the number line, and you need to move 3 units to the right.
