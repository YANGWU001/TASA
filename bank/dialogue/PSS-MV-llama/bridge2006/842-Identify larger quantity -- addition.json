How many pencils do you have now?\n\n**Task:** Draw a picture or sketch to represent the situation. Don't worry about calculating the answer yet; just focus on visualizing the problem.",

Can you think of a way to find out how many toys you have in total?\n\n**Interactive Step:** Let's use a visual aid to help you understand the concept. I'll draw a simple diagram on the board to represent the toy boxes and the number of toys in each one. This will help you see the problem in a more concrete way.\n\nHere's the diagram:\n```\n  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\n  | Box 1 (3) | Box 2 (2) | Box 3 (4) | Box 4 (1) | Box 5 (6) |\n  +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+\n```\nNow, let's focus on one step at a time.

Providing reassurance and acknowledging their uncertainty, which helps build trust and confidence.\n2. Using a relatable and visual scenario (toy boxes) to make the concept more tangible and easier to understand.\n3. Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (individual boxes) to reduce overwhelm and increase understanding.\n4. Asking a question that encourages critical thinking and problem-solving, rather than simply recalling information.\n\nBy responding to the student's uncertainty and providing a clear, step-by-step explanation, the tutor is adapting to their learning style and creating a supportive and non-intimidating learning environment.",
