This is often referred to as a \"hands-on\" or \"experiential\" learning style.\n\nHere's some feedback tailored to your learning style:\n\n* You're on the right track by preferring hands-on activities! This approach allows you to engage with the material in a more concrete way, which can help solidify your understanding and retention.\n* Watching a short video beforehand can also be a great way to get a sense of what to expect and how to approach the activity. This can help you feel more prepared and confident when you start the hands-on part.\n* To further support your learning, I'd like to suggest that we incorporate more interactive and experiential activities into our sessions. This could include simulations, games, or other hands-on exercises that allow you to apply what you're learning in a real-world context.\n\nHere's a question that matches your preferences:\n\nWhat if we were to incorporate a \"design challenge\" into our sessions? For example, if we're learning about a new topic, I could provide you with a real-world scenario or problem, and you could work through it step-by-step using the concepts we've learned. Would you find this type of approach engaging and helpful?",

Since you mentioned you like working on real-world problems and using concepts step-by-step, I'd like to provide you with some feedback on how you can apply this approach to our lessons.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n- You're right on track by wanting to try out hands-on activities and experiments. This is a great way to engage with the material and reinforce your understanding.\n- Your idea of watching a short video first to get an idea of what to expect is also excellent. It helps you prepare and gives you a mental framework for the hands-on activities that follow.\n- To take it to the next level, consider creating a checklist or a step-by-step guide as you work through the activities. This will help you stay organized and ensure you don't miss any crucial steps.\n\n**Next Question:**\nLet's try another question that matches your preferences. Here's a prompt:\n\nImagine you're tasked with designing a new product that needs to be both eco-friendly and cost-effective. You have a few different materials to choose from, but you're not sure which one to use. How would you go about deciding, and what steps would you take to design the product?\n\nThis question allows you to work on a real-world problem, apply the concepts we've learned, and use a hands-on approach to design a solution. You can also consider watching a short video or reading a brief introduction to get an idea of the requirements and constraints before starting your design process.",

This will help you organize your thoughts and make connections between the different factors.\n\nNow, let's move on to the next step. To further explore the eco-friendly materials you're interested in, I'd like to ask:\n\n**Can you think of a real-world product that could benefit from using eco-friendly materials, and how would you apply the concepts we've discussed so far to design a prototype for that product?**\n\nThis question aligns with your preference for working on real-world problems and designing a product step-by-step.",

This will help you better weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each material. For example, you might consider factors like durability, insulation, and cost.\n\nAdditionally, I think it would be helpful to create a simple **Value Matrix** to prioritize the materials based on their pros and cons. This will allow you to see which materials align with your design goals and values.\n\nHere's an example of what the Value Matrix might look like:\n\n| Material | Importance (1-5) | Pros (1-5) | Cons (1-5) | Priority Score |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\nWhat do you think about creating this Value Matrix to help you prioritize the materials for your reusable coffee cup design?",

However, I want to suggest that we add a few more columns to help us think about the user experience. What do you think about adding columns for 'User Comfort' and 'Ease of Cleaning'? These will help us think about how the cup feels in the user's hand and how easy it is to clean.\n\nThis will also give us a chance to think about the trade-offs between different materials and how they affect the user experience. For example, a cup made of a more durable material might be heavier or less comfortable to hold.\n\nWhat do you think?
