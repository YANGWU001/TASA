You're given a set of numbers, and you need to find the factors of each number. The twist? You have to work quickly, as a \"factor thief\" is trying to steal the correct answers!\n\nLet's play a round to get started. I'll give you a number, and you try to find its factors.

You've got some of them right: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 12. However, there are a couple more factors that we can discover together. Remember, factors are the numbers that divide a number evenly without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the number 12. Can you think of any other numbers that divide 12 evenly? For example, we know 1 x 12 = 12 and 2 x 6 = 12. Are there any other combinations that work?\n\n**Next question that matches their preferences:**\n\nLet's play a game to find the missing factors of 12. I'll give you a few options to choose from:\n\nA) A math problem to solve\nB) A game to find the missing factors (you chose this option initially)\nC) A visual diagram to explore\nD) A real-world example to apply the concept\n\nWhich one would you like to do next?",
