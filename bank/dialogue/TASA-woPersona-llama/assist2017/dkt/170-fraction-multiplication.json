    "content": "**Concise Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student correctly identified that to multiply fractions with different denominators, they need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. They correctly determined the LCM of 4 and 6 to be 12. However, when rewriting the fractions with the common denominator, they incorrectly rewrote 3/6 as 6/12, instead of 3/12. The correct rewriting of the fractions with the common denominator 12 is 1/4 = 3/12 and 3/6 = 6/12. \n\nThe student then multiplied the numerators 3 and 6, resulting in 18, and kept the common denominator 12. The correct result of 1/4 multiplied by 3/6 is indeed 18/12, which can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6. After simplification, 18/12 becomes 3/2.\n\n**Clarification:**\n\nTo find the correct answer, the student should simplify 18/12 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 6. After simplification, 18/12 becomes 3/2, which is not among the answer choices. However, we can recognize that 3/2 is equivalent to 1.5, and we can also express it as a mixed number or a decimal to see if it matches any of the answer choices.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current understanding of fraction multiplication, it's essential to build upon their grasp of the concept by introducing a new scenario that focuses on finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators and applying it to fraction multiplication.
