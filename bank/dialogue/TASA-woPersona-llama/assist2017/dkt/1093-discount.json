    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student has attempted to calculate the price after a 20% discount on a book originally costing $25. To solve this problem, the student needs to apply the discount formula, which is: \n\nDiscounted Price = Original Price - (Discount Percentage x Original Price)\n\nIn this case, the discount percentage is 20%, which can be represented as 0.20. \n\nSo, the calculation would be: \nDiscounted Price = $25 - (0.20 x $25)\nDiscounted Price = $25 - $5\nDiscounted Price = $20\n\nThe student's answer, $20.50, is incorrect. The correct answer is $20. The student may have made a calculation error or misunderstood the concept of applying a discount.

To solve this problem, the student should have found 15% of $40, which is the discount amount. \n\nTo find 15% of $40, the student should have multiplied $40 by 0.15 (since 15% is equivalent to 0.15). This would be: \n\n0.15 x $40 = $6\n\nThe student's calculation error led to a misunderstanding of the discount amount. They initially thought 10% of $40 was $4 and 5% was $2, which added up to $6. However, they mistakenly thought this was the amount saved, not the discount amount. The correct answer is indeed $6, but the student needs to understand that this is the discount amount, not the amount saved. The amount saved would be the original price minus the discount amount, which is $40 - $6 = $34.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**A store is offering a 25% discount on all video games.
