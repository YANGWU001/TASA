They used the formula P = 2 \u00d7 (length + width) to calculate the perimeter, which is a great sign of their understanding. However, the student's answer to the question was incorrect. They stated that the new perimeter of the playground and the path is 34 meters, but they incorrectly concluded that the original perimeter was 26 meters. This mistake led to an incorrect answer.\n\nThe correct approach to the problem was to find the original perimeter, which the student did correctly. However, the student should have added the 4-meter increase to the original perimeter to find the new perimeter. Let's recalculate the new perimeter:\n\n1. The original perimeter is 26 meters.\n2. The path adds 4 meters to the perimeter.\n3.

    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student continues to struggle with accurately calculating the new perimeter after modifying the original shape. They provided an answer of 45 meters for the new perimeter, which is close but not entirely correct. This suggests a need for further practice and review of perimeter concepts, particularly in situations involving modifications to the original shape. \n\n**Next Question:**\n\nA square measures 8 meters in length on each side. A 0.5-meter wide border is added around the square. If a small section of the border, 2 meters long and 0.5 meter wide, is removed from one of the sides, what is the new perimeter of the square and the remaining border?\n\nTo approach this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. First, find the original perimeter of the square and the border. Add the border width to each side of the square.\n   The original perimeter is 4 \u00d7 (8 + 0.5) = 4 \u00d7 8.5 = 34 meters.\n\n2. Next, consider the section of the border that is removed. The removed section is 2 meters long and 0.5 meter wide. We need to subtract this section from the original perimeter.\n\n   The length of the removed section is 2 meters, so we subtract 0.5 meters from one of the sides of the border (since we added 0.5 meter to each side initially). The new length becomes 8 - 0.5 = 7.5 meters.\n   The width of the removed section is 0.5 meter, so we subtract 0.5 meters from the width of the square (since we added 0.5 meter to each side initially). The new width remains 8 meters.\n\n3. Now, find the new perimeter using the updated dimensions:\n   The new perimeter is 4 \u00d7 (7.5 + 0.5) = 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 meters.\n\nHowever, we need to subtract the section removed from the original perimeter. The perimeter of the removed section is 2 \u00d7 (2 + 0.5) = 2 \u00d7 2.5 = 5 meters.\nThe new perimeter is 34 - 5 = 29 meters.\n\nSo, the new perimeter of the square and the remaining border is 29 meters.\n\n**Question Options:**\n\nA) 27 meters\nB) 29 meters\nC) 31 meters\nD) 33 meters",
