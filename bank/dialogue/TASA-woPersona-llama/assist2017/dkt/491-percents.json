    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student started off by understanding the concept of a 10% discount, but then got confused when calculating 10% of $40. They initially thought of 10% as a fraction of the price, which is correct, and then used that to estimate the discount amount. The student correctly calculated 10% of $40 as $4, and then subtracted it from the original price of $40 to get the total amount. However, the student's self-doubt and willingness to reconsider their calculation is a great sign of growth and improvement, showing they are willing to double-check their work. The student's initial answer of $36 is actually correct.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question 10:**\n\nA water park is offering a 20% discount on all season passes. A season pass originally priced at $80 is on sale. How much will you pay for the season pass after the discount?\n\nA) $64\nB) $65\nC) $64.80\nD) $80\n\n**Why this question:**\n\n* This question builds on the student's existing knowledge of percents and applies it to a real-world scenario, helping them see the relevance and importance of percents in everyday life.\n* The discount amount is a percentage of the original price, allowing the student to practice finding a percentage of a number.\n* The answer choices are clear and concise, allowing the student to focus on the calculation rather than getting bogged down in complicated math.\n* This question is slightly more complex than the previous one, but still manageable for the student, allowing them to build on their existing knowledge and gain confidence in their understanding of percents.\n\nThis question also allows the student to practice calculating a percentage of a number, which is a fundamental skill in understanding percents.",
