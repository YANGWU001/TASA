What is the measure of the third angle?\n\nA) 20\u00b0\nB) 40\u00b0\nC) 60\u00b0\nD) 90\u00b0\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis question is designed to help the student recall the sum-of-interior-angles theorem for triangles, which states that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180\u00b0. By using this theorem, the student can find the measure of the third angle.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's say the measure of the third angle is x. According to the theorem, the sum of all interior angles is 180\u00b0:\n\n30\u00b0 + 60\u00b0 + x = 180\u00b0\n\nCombine the known angles:\n90\u00b0 + x = 180\u00b0\n\nSubtract 90\u00b0 from both sides:\nx = 90\u00b0\n\nSo, the measure of the third angle is 90\u00b0.\n\n**Answer:** D) 90\u00b0",

Instead of subtracting the sum of the given angles from the total angle sum in a triangle (180\u00b0), the student mistakenly concluded that the third angle would be 60\u00b0. However, the correct approach would be to subtract 120\u00b0 from 180\u00b0, which would result in 60\u00b0. The student's hesitation and uncertainty are signs that they are still struggling to solidify their understanding of the theorem. \n\n**Next Question Tailored to the Student's Current Knowledge State:**\n\n**Practice Question 9: Easy Level**\n\nA triangle has two angles that measure 30\u00b0 and 75\u00b0. What is the measure of the third angle?\n\nA) 30\u00b0\nB) 75\u00b0\nC) 75\u00b0\nD) 75\u00b0\n\nThis question is designed to help the student practice the sum-of-interior-angles theorem with a new set of angles, focusing on the difference between the given angles and the total angle sum in a triangle.",
