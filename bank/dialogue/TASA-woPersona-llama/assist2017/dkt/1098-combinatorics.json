If we have 6 books to arrange on the shelves, how many ways can we choose 3 books to place on the first shelf?\n\n**Objective:**\nThis question is designed to introduce the concept of combinations (choosing items from a larger set without regard to order). The student will practice selecting a subset of items (books) from a larger set (the 6 available books), which is a fundamental idea in combinatorics.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\nThis question is a gentle introduction to combinations, as it doesn't require the student to calculate the total number of ways to arrange all 6 books on the shelves, which would involve permutations. Instead, it focuses on selecting 3 books out of 6, which is a more manageable and foundational concept in combinatorics.",
