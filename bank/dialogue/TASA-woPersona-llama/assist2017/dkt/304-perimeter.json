What is the perimeter of the garden?\n\n**A)** 18 meters\n**B)** 22 meters\n**C)** 26 meters\n**D)** 30 meters\n\nThis question reviews the student's understanding of calculating the perimeter of a rectangle, which they've shown proficiency in previously.

    "content": "**Student's Last Answer Explanation:**\n\nThe student answered that the perimeter of the rectangular garden is 22 meters, selecting option **B**. This is incorrect. To find the perimeter of a rectangle, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.\n\nGiven the garden measures 8 meters in length (l = 8) and 5 meters in width (w = 5), we can calculate the perimeter as follows:\n\nP = 2(8 + 5)\nP = 2(13)\nP = 26\n\nSo, the correct answer is **C)** 26 meters. The student's incorrect answer, 22 meters, is close but not accurate. This suggests that the student might be relying on memorization or not fully understanding the concept of perimeter.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo further assess the student's understanding, let's try a question that requires applying the perimeter formula to a slightly more complex scenario.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA rectangular park has a length of 15 meters and a width of 9 meters.

However, their approach was partially correct but incomplete. They recognized that the path adds to the length and width of the park, which is a good start.

This question will also review the concept of adding extra dimensions.\n\n**Question:**\n\nA rectangular garden has a length of 25 meters and a width of 12 meters. A 2-meter-wide border is built around the garden. What is the new perimeter of the garden, including the border?\n\n**A)** 80 meters\n**B)** 84 meters\n**C)** 88 meters\n**D)** 92 meters\n\nThis question builds on the previous scenarios by introducing a larger garden and a wider border, requiring the student to apply their understanding of perimeter to a more manageable scenario. The student will need to add the border to each side of the garden and apply the perimeter formula to find the correct answer.",
