(Because 5\u202f% is like 1/20, and $108 \u00f7\u202f20 \u2248 $5.4, but I\u2019m not sure.)  \nIf I just subtract $5, I get $108\u00a0\u2013\u00a0$5\u202f=\u202f$103, which isn\u2019t an answer choice."

    "content": "**Student's Last Answer Explanation:**\n\nThe student's last answer was $90.50. They correctly found the first discount (25% of $120 = $30), which results in a price of $90 after the first discount. However, when calculating the second discount (5% of $90), the student made an error, first by correctly finding 5% of $90 ($4.50) and then subtracting it from $90, resulting in $85.50. Then, the student incorrectly applied the second discount to the original price ($120), finding 5% of $120 ($6), and added it to $90, resulting in $90 + $0.50 = $90.50. The student expressed some uncertainty in their calculations, but ultimately chose $90.50 as their final answer.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question:**\n\nA bookshelf has a set of 8 books, each priced at $15. If a 10% discount is applied to the total price, followed by a 5% discount on the discounted price, what is the final price of the 8 books?\n\nA) $108.00\nB) $109.20\nC) $109.80\nD) $110.40\nE) $111.00\n\n**Explanation:** This question requires the student to apply their understanding of percents to a real-world scenario, involving multiple discounts. They need to find 10% of the total price of $120 (8 books x $15 = $120), subtract it from the original price, and then find 5% of the new price (the second discount). The correct answer is $109.80. This question will help the student practice applying percents to a more relatable situation, making it easier for them to understand and remember the concept.\n\n**What to look for in the student's response:**\n\n* Correctly calculates the total price of the 8 books ($120)\n* Applies the 10% discount to the total price ($12 off $120 = $108)\n* Finds the correct 5% discount on the new price ($108)\n* Avoids applying the second discount to the original price\n* Selects the correct answer ($109.80)",
