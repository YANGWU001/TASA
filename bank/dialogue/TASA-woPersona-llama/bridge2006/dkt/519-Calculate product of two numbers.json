They understood that to find the total cost, they needed to multiply the cost of each ticket ($12) by the number of tickets they want to buy (6). The student's calculation, \\(12 \\times 6 = 72\\), is accurate. However, they were uncertain about their answer because it didn't match any of the provided options. \n\nSince the student's calculation is correct, but the answer choice is not listed, it's possible that they may have been hesitant due to the discrepancy. The closest option to their correct answer is **C) $84**, but it's essential to note that the correct answer is indeed $72, which is not an option. This slight hesitation and self-doubt demonstrate the student's growing confidence in applying mathematical concepts but also highlight the need for practice in navigating real-world scenarios with varying answer formats.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current progress, let's try a question that builds upon their understanding of calculating the product of two numbers and introduces a slight variation.
