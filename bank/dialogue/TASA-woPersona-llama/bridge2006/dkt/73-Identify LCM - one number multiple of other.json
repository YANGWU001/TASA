However, they seem to be struggling to factorize 60 correctly. \n\nTo accurately find the prime factorization of 60, we can break it down further: 60 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 15 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5. So, the prime factorization of 60 is indeed 2^2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo further reinforce the concept, let's try another question that's similar but with a slight twist.

    "content": "Um\u2026 I think the LCM of 12 and 20 might be\u2026 let\u2019s see.  \n\nFirst I\u2019ll break them down:  \n\n-\u202f12 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f6 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3, so the prime factors are 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3.  \n-\u202f20 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10 = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5, so the prime factors are 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f5.  \n\nNow, to get the LCM we take the highest power of each prime that shows up.  \nWe have 2\u00b2 from both, a 3 from 12, and a 5 from 20.  \n\nSo I guess we multiply them together: 2\u00b2\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 4\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 12\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = **60**.  \n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally sure if I\u2019m supposed to include the 3 and the 5 both, or maybe I only need the bigger of the two numbers? Actually, now that I think about it, maybe the LCM is just the product"

    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student is attempting to break down the numbers into their prime factors and find the LCM. They correctly identified the prime factorization of 12 as 2^2 \u00d7 3 and 20 as 2^2 \u00d7 5. They then recognized the need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either number, which is 2^2, 3, and 5. However, their conclusion is partially correct but not entirely accurate. They multiplied the highest powers together to get 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 60, which is actually the product of the LCM, but they didn't explicitly state the LCM itself. The student's thought process shows some understanding of the concept, but they're still unsure about the final answer.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo further reinforce the concept, let's try another question that's similar but with a slight twist.
