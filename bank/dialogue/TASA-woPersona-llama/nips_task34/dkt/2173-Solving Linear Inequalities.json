They correctly subtracted 5 from both sides, resulting in 2x > 6. However, when dividing both sides by 2, they incorrectly simplified the inequality to x > 2. The correct solution is x > 3, as shown in the step-by-step solution provided.\n\nThe student's mistake likely stems from a misunderstanding of the division operation on the inequality. In inequalities, when dividing both sides by a positive number (in this case, 2), the direction of the inequality remains the same. However, the student incorrectly flipped the inequality sign.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current knowledge state and the mistake in their previous answer, the next question should focus on reinforcing the concept of dividing both sides of an inequality by a positive number.
