They correctly identified the need to perform the addition first, which is a good start. They added 24 and 3 correctly, resulting in 27. However, they then struggled with the subtraction operation. It seems they are still uncertain about the order of operations and may be unsure about how to proceed with the subtraction.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nGiven the student's current knowledge state, the next question should focus on reinforcing their understanding of the addition and subtraction rules within the BIDMAS sequence. To make it more accessible, I'll provide a question that only involves addition and subtraction operations.\n\n**Question:** Evaluate the expression: 5 + 2 + 11",
