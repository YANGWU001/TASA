    "content": "**Student's Last Answer Analysis:**\n\nThe student's last answer, **A) 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 11**, is partially correct, but not entirely accurate. They correctly identified the prime numbers 3 and 11 as factors of 99, but included the composite number 9, which is not a prime number. The number 9 can be broken down into 3 \u00d7 3, but in the context of prime factorization, it's not necessary to include the composite factor 9. \n\nA more accurate prime factorization of 99 would be **B) 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 11**, as it only includes the prime factors 3 and 11, without the composite number 9.\n\n**Next Question:**\n\nTo reinforce the student's understanding of prime factors and build upon their existing knowledge, let's move on to a new question that requires them to apply their understanding of prime factors to a specific problem. The next question is:\n\nWhat is the prime factorization of the number 105?\n\nA) 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7\nB) 1 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7\nC) 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7\nD) 1 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5\n\nThis question requires the student to apply their understanding of prime factors to a new number, 105, and identify the correct prime factorization.\n\nNote: This question is designed to help the student practice breaking down numbers into their prime factors, and to avoid including composite numbers in the factorization.",
