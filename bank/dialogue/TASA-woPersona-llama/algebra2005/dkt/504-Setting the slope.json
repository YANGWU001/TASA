The formula is: slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Applying this formula to the given points, we get slope = (4 - 9) / (7 - 4) = -5 / 3.\n\n**Why this question is suitable:**\n\n* It's a basic application of the slope formula, which is a fundamental concept in setting the slope.\n* The numbers are simple and easy to work with, reducing the likelihood of errors due to arithmetic mistakes.\n* The student can use their recent practice to recall the formula and apply it to the given points, with a slight twist to help them practice the calculation.\n\nThis question will help the student assess their understanding of the concept and provide an opportunity to practice setting the slope with a simple and manageable problem, while also helping them to overcome their previous mistake.",
