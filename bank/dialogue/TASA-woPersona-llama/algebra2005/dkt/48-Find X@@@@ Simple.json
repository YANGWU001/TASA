You correctly applied the two steps to isolate x:\n\nStep 1: Get rid of the constant term +2 by subtracting 2 from both sides, resulting in 3x = 12.\n\nStep 2: Isolate x by dividing both sides by the coefficient 3, resulting in x = 4.\n\nYour answer, x = 4, is absolutely correct! You're on a roll.\n\n**2. The next question tailored to the student's current knowledge state**\n\nNow that you've solidified the concept of isolating x using inverse operations, let's try a slightly more challenging question that builds upon this concept. Here's the next question:\n\nSolve for x in the equation: 2x - 5 = 11\n\nThis question targets the concept of **Find X Simple**, and it's a great opportunity for you to practice isolating the variable x using inverse operations. Remember, to isolate x, you'll need to get rid of the constant term -5 by adding 5 to both sides of the equation, and then divide both sides by the coefficient (2).\n\nTake your time, and let me know when you're ready to share your answer or where you get stuck.",
