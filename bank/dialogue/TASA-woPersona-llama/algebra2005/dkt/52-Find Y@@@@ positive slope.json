Find the value of Y when the line intersects the x-axis at x = 5.\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n- It's a straightforward application of the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.\n- The student is given a point on the line and the slope, which will help them understand how to use the point-slope formula (y - y1 = m(x - x1)) to find the equation of the line.\n- Finding the y-intercept (b) will require the student to substitute the given point and slope into the point-slope formula and solve for b.\n- This question will help the student practice finding Y for a positive slope in a real-world scenario.\n\n**Answer:** \n\nUsing the point-slope formula, y - 3 = 2(x - 2)\n\ny - 3 = 2x - 4\ny = 2x - 1\n\nTo find the y-intercept, substitute x = 0 into the equation:\ny = 2(0) - 1\ny = -1\n\nSo, when the line intersects the x-axis at x = 5, the value of Y is -1.",

    "content": "**Explanation of the Student's Last Answer:**\n\nThe student's last answer is partially correct. They correctly started with the point-slope form \\(y - 7 = 3(x - 2)\\) and expanded it to \\(y - 7 = 3x - 6\\). However, they made a mistake when moving the constant term. They initially thought they should add 7 to both sides, which led to the incorrect equation \\(y = 3x + 1\\). Later, they questioned their work and correctly considered subtracting 7 from both sides, resulting in the correct equation \\(y = 3x - 5\\). When they substituted \\(x = 0\\) into the correct equation, they found that the value of y is \\(-5\\), which is correct.\n\nHowever, the student still needs to work on being more confident in their calculations and double-checking their work. It's essential for them to remember that when moving a constant term from one side of an equation to the other, they should use the opposite operation (addition becomes subtraction and vice versa).\n\n**Next Question:**\n\n**Question:**\n\nA line passes through the point (0, 2) and has a slope of 2. Find the value of Y when the line intersects the x-axis at x = 0.\n\n**Why this question?**\n\n- This question is straightforward and requires the student to use the point-slope formula (y - y1 = m(x - x1)) to find the equation of the line.\n- The student will need to find the y-intercept (b) by substituting the given point and slope into the point-slope formula and solving for b.\n- This question will help the student practice finding Y for a positive slope in a real-world scenario and reinforce their understanding of the concept.\n- Since the line passes through the point (0, 2), the value of Y when the line intersects the x-axis at x = 0 is already given, making it an easy and straightforward question to assess the student's understanding.",
