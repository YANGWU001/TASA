If 2 more books are added to the shelf, how many books are on the bookshelf now?\n\nA) 3\nB) 5\nC) 7\nD) 10\n\n**Explanation:**\nTo solve this problem, the student needs to understand that when adding small numbers, they can simply count the initial amount and then add the additional amount. In this case, the student starts with 5 books and adds 2 more, so they need to count up from 5 to 7.\n\nThis question is designed to be simple and easy to understand, with a small number of digits involved. The correct answer is C) 7, and the student can check their work by counting up from 5: 5, 6, 7.",
