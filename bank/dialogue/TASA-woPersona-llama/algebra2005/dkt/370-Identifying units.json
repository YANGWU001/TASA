Milliliters are a unit of volume measurement, not length. The correct unit of measurement for length is typically in units such as centimeters, meters, or inches.\n\n**Explanation:**\nLet's review what we know about units of measurement. Units of measurement are used to express the size or amount of something. For length, we use units like centimeters, meters, or inches. Volume, on the other hand, is measured in units like milliliters or liters. So, when we're talking about the length of an object like a pencil, we need to use a length unit.\n\n**Next Question:**\nHere's another question that's related to identifying units, but with a different context:\n\n**Question 2:**\nWhat is the unit of measurement for the weight of a book?\n\nA) Square centimeters\nB) Milliliters\nC) Grams\nD) Kilometers\n\nThis question is a bit more straightforward, and the student can practice identifying the correct unit of measurement for weight, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics.",
