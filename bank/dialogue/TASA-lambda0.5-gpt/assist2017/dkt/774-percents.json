I guess I could take half of 10\u202f% (since 5\u202f% is half), but for 2\u202f% I\u2019m not sure\u2026 maybe I just take 1\u202f% twice.  \n1\u202f% of 250 would be moving the decimal two places left, which is 2.5.  \nSo 2\u202f% would be 2\u202f\u00d7\u202f2.5\u202f=\u202f5.\n\nNow I add the two chunks:  \n25 (for the 10\u202f%) +\u202f5 (for the 2\u202f%) = **30**.\n\nBut\u2026 I\u2019m not totally confident. I think maybe I made a mistake with the 2\u202f% part\u2014maybe it should be a little smaller? If I guessed a different number, I\u2019d say maybe the answer is **28** instead of 30.  \n\nSo, I\u2019m not sure\u2026 is"

The next step is to get comfortable with the smaller pieces (5\u202f%, 1\u202f%, 2\u202f%, etc.) and to see them as \u201cjust a few more tiny steps\u201d from the 10\u202f% you know so well.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next practice problem\n\n**What is 18\u202f% of 340?**\n\nTry to solve it **both ways** (you can pick whichever you prefer first, then verify with the other):\n\n1. **Chunk method** \u2013 break 18\u202f% into pieces you know well (e.g., 10\u202f%\u202f+\u202f5\u202f%\u202f+\u202f2\u202f%\u202f+\u202f1\u202f%).  \n2. **Decimal method** \u2013 write 18\u202f% as 0.18 and multiply.\n\nWhen you\u2019re done, write a short sentence for each step (e.g., \u201c10\u202f% of 340 = 34\u201d) and give the final answer.\n\n*If you get stuck on any chunk, just let me know which part feels fuzzy and we\u2019ll unpack it together.* \ud83c\udf1f\n\nLooking forward to seeing your work!",
