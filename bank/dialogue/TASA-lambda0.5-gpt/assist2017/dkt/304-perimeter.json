Pick the one that feels most natural to you and use it for every rectangle problem \u2013 it will keep the two\u2011step method and the fast\u2011check in perfect sync.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Count\u2011up method (the one\u2011by\u2011one walk)\n\n> **Goal:** Start at the larger number and take as many \u201c+1\u201d steps as the smaller number tells you.\n\n```\nStart at 12\n+1 \u2192 13   (1st step)\n+1 \u2192 14   (2nd step)\n+1 \u2192 15   (3rd step)\n+1 \u2192 16   (4th step)\n+1 \u2192 17   (5th step)\n+1 \u2192 18   (6th step)\n+1 \u2192 19   (7th step)\n+1 \u2192 20   (8th step)\n+1 \u2192 21   (9th step)   \u2190 stop, we\u2019ve taken 9 steps\n```\n\n**Result:** 12\u202f+\u202f9\u202f=\u202f21  \n\nIf you ever feel \u201cI\u2019m losing track\u201d, just **say the numbers out loud** as you step: \u201ctwelve, thirteen, fourteen\u2026\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Break\u2011apart (or \u201cmake\u2011a\u2011ten\u201d) method\n\nWrite the smaller addend as a round\u2011number\u202f+\u202fremainder.\n\n```\n12 + 9 = 12 + (10 \u2013 1)\n        = (12 + 10) \u2013 1\n        = 22 \u2013 1\n        = 21\n```\n\nThe trick is: **adding a round number (10, 20, 100) is instant**, then you just subtract the tiny remainder.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Complement\u2011to\u201110 method (great for mental math)\n\nThink of how far the larger number is from the next multiple of 10.\n\n```\n12 is 2 away from 10 \u2192 complement is 8\n9 = 8 + 1\nSo 12 + 9 = (12 + 8) + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21\n```\n\nAny of these will give you the correct \u201csum\u201d that you need for the two\u2011step perimeter formula.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccf Quick recap of the two\u2011step perimeter formula  \n\n1. **Add length\u202f+\u202fwidth** \u2192 call this **S**.  \n2. **Multiply S by 2** \u2192 perimeter **P = 2\u202f\u00d7\u202fS**.\n\nThe fast\u2011check does the same work in a slightly different order:\n\n- Compute **2\u202f\u00d7\u202flength**  \n- Compute **2\u202f\u00d7\u202fwidth**  \n- Add those two products.\n\nBoth routes must give the *same* final number. If they don\u2019t, the mistake is almost always in the addition step (the \u201c+\u201d part) or in the multiplication by\u202f2.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Your next practice problem (with a tiny hint)\n\n> **Problem:** A rectangular patio is **15\u202fm long** and **7\u202fm wide**.  \n> Find its perimeter.  \n\n**What to do**\n\n1. **Two\u2011step method**  \n   - Add 15\u202f+\u202f7 \u2192 write the intermediate sum **S**.  \n   - Multiply **S** by 2 \u2192 write the final perimeter.\n\n2. **Fast\u2011check**  \n   - Compute\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f15 \u2192 write that product.  \n   - Compute\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f7 \u2192 write that product.  \n   - Add the two products \u2192 write the final perimeter.\n\n**Hint:** Use whichever addition trick (count\u2011up, break\u2011apart, complement\u2011to\u201110) feels easiest for you when you add 15\u202f+\u202f7.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc49 What I\u2019d love from you\n\n- Paste **exactly** what you write for each step",
