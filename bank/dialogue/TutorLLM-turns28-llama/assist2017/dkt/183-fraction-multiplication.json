Let's review the concept together.\n\nTo multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) and the denominators (the numbers on the bottom) separately. So, for 1/2 and 3/4, we multiply 1 and 3 to get 3, and 2 and 4 to get 8.\n\nThe correct product is 3/8. You can also convert this fraction to a decimal or a percent to make it more familiar to you. For example, 3/8 as a decimal is 0.375, and as a percent is 37.5%.\n\nDon't worry if you made a mistake \u2013 it's all part of the learning process.

To multiply fractions, we need to multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) and the denominators (the numbers on the bottom) separately.\n\nFor example, to find the product of 1/2 and 3/4, we multiply 1 (the numerator of the first fraction) by 3 (the numerator of the second fraction), and then multiply 2 (the denominator of the first fraction) by 4 (the denominator of the second fraction).\n\nSo, the product would be (1 \u00d7 3) / (2 \u00d7 4) = 3/8.\n\nLet's try another question that might help you feel more confident with fraction-multiplication.\n\nHere's your next practice question:\n\nQuestion: What is the product of 2/3 and 5/6?",

It's great that you're being honest about not knowing the answer.

We've worked on area questions and mean questions, but it seems like the area question didn't quite click, and we also had a misunderstanding with the mean question. I want to connect the dots and help you see the relationship between these concepts and fraction-multiplication.\n\nTo multiply fractions, we need to multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) and multiply the denominators (the numbers on the bottom), and then simplify the result.

Don't worry, it's completely normal to feel that way, especially after seeing unit-conversion problems which seem to be causing some confusion. You've struggled with those in the past, and it's possible that the concepts are getting mixed up in your mind.\n\nHowever, I want to emphasize that fraction-multiplication is a distinct concept that requires a different approach. To multiply fractions, we need to multiply the numerators together and the denominators together, which might seem a bit counterintuitive if you're used to unit-conversion problems. Let's take a step back and focus on fraction-multiplication specifically.\n\n**Breaking it down:**\n\nTo multiply fractions, we need to multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) and the denominators (the numbers on the bottom) separately. For example, if we want to multiply 1/2 and 3/4, we would multiply the numerators (1 and 3) to get 3, and the denominators (2 and 4) to get 8.
