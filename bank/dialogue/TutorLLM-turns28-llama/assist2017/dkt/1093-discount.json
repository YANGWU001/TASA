Let's break down the steps you might have taken to arrive at your answer. \n\nHowever, based on the context, I'm going to assume that the question was something like: \"A shirt originally costs $100. If it's on sale for 20% off, how much will you pay?\"\n\nIf that's the case, to calculate the discount, you would first find 20% of $100. To do this, multiply $100 by 0.2 (20% expressed as a decimal). This gives you $20. \n\nNext, you would subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the sale price: $100 - $20 = $80. \n\nSo, the correct answer would be $80, not $22.50.\n\nDon't worry if you're still unsure about the math.

Remember, we discussed this before, and you know that to find the discount, you need to find 20% of the original price, then subtract that from the original price. \n\nIn the case of the previous problem, you found 20% of $60, which is correct ($12). However, you got stuck when trying to calculate the discount from $80. Let's break it down together: 20% of $80 is actually $16 (not $20). To find 20% of a number, you multiply the number by 0.20. So, 80 \u00d7 0.20 = 16.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the original problem: the discount would be $16, so the price after the discount would be $80 - $16 = $64. \n\nDon't worry, it's okay to make mistakes.
