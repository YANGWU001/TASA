This might be because you're thinking of the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral, which is 360\u00b0. \n\nLet's review the concept together. The sum of interior angles in a triangle is a fundamental property of geometry, and it's essential to remember that it's always 180\u00b0, regardless of the type of triangle (acute, right, or obtuse). \n\nNext, let's try another practice question to see if we can improve your understanding and accuracy.\n\nPractice Question 2:\nWhat is the sum of interior angles in a triangle?",

You might be confusing it with the fact that a circle has 360\u00b0, but triangles and circles are different shapes with different properties.

Let's try to recall it together.\n\n**Recall the correct formula:** The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is always 180\u00b0.\n\n**Why is this the case?** It's because the sum of the three interior angles is the total amount of the turn that you can make when you move around a triangle, and a full turn is 360\u00b0. When you subtract one angle from a full turn, you get 360\u00b0 - 180\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n\nGiven this, I'm confident that you can remember that the sum of interior angles in a triangle is indeed 180\u00b0.\n\n**Practice Question:**\nA triangle has two angles measuring 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0.

You mentioned that you tried to remember this rule, but got mixed up. \n\nLet's break it down together: the three interior angles of a triangle are like three parts of a whole. If we consider 180\u00b0 as the whole, we can think of the sum of the three interior angles as 180\u00b0 = angle A + angle B + angle C. To find the missing angle, we need to subtract the sum of the other two angles from 180\u00b0.\n\nIn this case, we don't have the values of angle A and angle B, but if we assume they are x and y, then the equation would be 180\u00b0 = x + y + z. To find the missing angle z, we would need to know the values of x and y.\n\nHowever, I think I see what's causing your confusion.
