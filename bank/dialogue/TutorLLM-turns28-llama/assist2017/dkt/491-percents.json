Since 25% is one-quarter of a whole, we can find 25% of 20 by dividing 20 by 4 (since 100% is the whole and 25% is 1/4 of it).

However, I think there might be some misunderstanding in your calculation. \n\nLet's break it down step by step. To find 15% of 30, you correctly identified that 10% is 3. Then, you added half of that, which is indeed 1.5. However, to find 15%, you need to add half of the 10% value, not the 10% value itself. So, it should be 3 + (half of 3) = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5. \n\nBut we need to find 15%, so we multiply 4.5 by 1.5 (since 15% is 1.5 times 10%). 4.5 * 1.5 = 6.75. Therefore, the correct answer is 6.75.

Instead of thinking of 10% as 12, let's think about what 10% of 120 is. 10% of 120 is actually 12, but this is because 10% is 1/10 of the number, so you multiply 120 by 1/10. To find 15%, we need to find 1/10 of 120 and then multiply it by 1.5 (since 15% is 1.5 times 10%).\n\nLet's try it together: 10% of 120 is 12 (because 120 x 1/10 = 12), and then 15% is 1.5 x 12 = 18.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 18.

You already know that 10% of 100 is 12, so to find 15%, you can add 5% of 100, which is 6, to 10% of 100, which is 12. This gives you a total of 18.

To find 20% of 60, you would multiply 0.20 (which is 20% as a decimal) by 60. \n\nLet's break it down step by step. To find 20% of 60, you can think of it as:\n\n1.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nTo better understand percents, we need to recall that the mean is the average of a set of numbers. When dealing with percents, we often need to find the mean of a range, like 10% to 5%. This can be tricky, but if we break it down, we can see that 15% is actually the midpoint between 10% and 20%.\n\nTo find the mean of two numbers, we add them together and divide by 2. So, if we want to find the mean of 10% and 20%, we would add 10 + 20 and divide by 2, which equals 15.

It's clear that we still need to work on reinforcing some concepts, especially with percents. Since you've been struggling with this topic for a while, let's take a step back and review the basics.\n\nTo calculate the mean of percents, we need to add the percentages and then divide by the number of values. In this case, we're adding 10% and 20%. To do that, we need to convert them to decimal form by dividing by 100. So, 10% becomes 0.1 and 20% becomes 0.2. Then, we add them together: 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3. Finally, to get the mean, we divide by the number of values, which is 2. So, 0.3 \u00f7 2 = 0.15.\n\nLet's try to relate this to a real-life scenario to make it more meaningful.

Let's take a step back and look at how percents relate to means.\n\nSince you struggled with mean questions in the past, let's try to connect percents to the concept of averages. When we calculate a mean, we're essentially finding the average of a set of numbers. If we then convert that average into a percentage, we're looking at the proportion of the total that the average represents.\n\nFor example, if we have a set of test scores with an average of 80, and we want to find the percentage of the total score that 80 represents, we can use the following formula:\n\n(average / total) x 100\n\nIn this case, if the total score is 100, the calculation would be:\n\n(80 / 100) x 100 = 80%\n\nThis shows that 80 is 80% of the total score. Does this make sense to you, or would you like to explore more examples to help solidify the connection between means and percents?\n\n**Next Practice Question**\n\nHere's a question to help you practice applying this concept:\n\nQuestion: What percentage of the total score is a mean of 85 if the total score is 120?\n\nA) 60%\nB) 70%\nC) 80%\nD) 90%\n\nPlease choose an answer and we can discuss your thought process and any questions you may have.",
