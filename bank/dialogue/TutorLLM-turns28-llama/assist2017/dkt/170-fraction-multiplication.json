We need to multiply 1/2 by 1/4. \n\nTo do this, we can use the number line or the concept of equivalent ratios. If we use the number line, we can move 1/2 of the distance from 0 to 1, and then move 1/4 of the distance from 0 to 1 again. This would put us at 1/8. However, in this case, it's easier to use the concept of equivalent ratios. When we multiply fractions, we multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) and multiply the denominators (the numbers on the bottom). So, 1/2 x 1/4 = (1 x 1) / (2 x 4) = 1/8. But, this is a special case where the result is the same as the original fraction. However, in the question, I will provide a different answer.\n\nLet's try another question.",

When multiplying fractions, you need to multiply the numerators (the numbers on top) and multiply the denominators (the numbers on the bottom). In this case, you're trying to multiply 2/3 and 5/6. \n\nYou're correct in calculating 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 for the numerator, but you got the denominator wrong.
