Write **3** after the decimal point.  \n3. **Subtract** 30\u202f\u2013\u202f24 = 6, bring down the next 0 \u2192\u202f60.  \n4. 8 goes into 60 seven times (7\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f56). Write **7**.  \n5. Subtract 60\u202f\u2013\u202f56 = 4, bring down the last 0 \u2192\u202f40.  \n6. 8 goes into 40 five times (5\u202f\u00d7\u202f8\u202f=\u202f40). Write **5**.  \n7. Remainder is 0, so the division stops. The decimal is **0.375**.\n\nIf any of those steps feel fuzzy, just tell me which part, and I\u2019ll give a more focused hint.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf After you finish\n\nOnce you\u2019ve filled in the three blanks, we\u2019ll move on to a **quick \u201ccheck\u2011your\u2011understanding\u201d** problem that mixes both the fraction\u2011\u2192\u2011decimal and decimal\u2011\u2192\u2011percent ideas, so you can see the whole process",
