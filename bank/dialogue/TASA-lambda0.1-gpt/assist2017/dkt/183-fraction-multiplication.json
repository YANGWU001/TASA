Keep that picture\u2011making habit \u2013 it\u2019s the key to mastering fraction multiplication.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0e Let\u2019s look again at the numerator product  \n\nYou wrote  \n\n```\nStep\u202f1 = 12\n```  \n\nThat would be the result of \\(4 \\times 3\\) (or \\(3 \\times 4\\)), not \\(5 \\times 3\\).  \nHere\u2019s a quick, concrete way to see why the answer is **15**:\n\n### Visual \u201cgroup\u2011of\u2011dots\u201d picture\n\n```\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf   \u2190 group\u202f1 (5)\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf   \u2190 group\u202f2 (5)\n\u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf \u25cf   \u2190 group\u202f3 (5)\n```\n\nCount all the dots:  \n\n\\(5 + 5 + 5 = 15\\)\n\n### Number\u2011line walk\n\n1. Start at 0.  \n2. Make **three jumps**, each jump of size **5**.  \n   * 0 \u2192 5 \u2192 10 \u2192 15  \n\nYou land on **15**, not 12.\n\n### Re\u2011written as repeated addition\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 3 = 5 + 5 + 5 = 15\n\\]\n\nSo the correct numerator product is **15**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Your turn again\n\nPlease type the corrected numerator product:\n\n```\nStep\u202f1 = ?\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccf Next step: multiply the denominators  \n\nOnce we have the right numerator product, we\u2019ll do the same thing with the denominators:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Denominator product} = 8 \\times 7\n\\]\n\n**Hint:** Think of \u201cseven groups of eight\u201d (or \u201ceight groups of seven\u201d).  \n\n- Write it as repeated addition: \\(8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8\\)  \n- Or picture seven groups of eight dots.\n\nWhat total do you get?  \n\n```\nStep\u202f2 = ?\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 Putting it together  \n\nWhen we have both products, the fraction\u2011multiplication rule says:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{8}\\times\\frac{3}{7}= \\frac{\\text{(numerator product)}}{\\text{(denominator product)}}\n\\]\n\nAfter you\u2019ve entered **Step\u202f1** and **Step\u202f2**, we\u2019ll write the combined fraction and see if it can be simplified.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Quick check\u2011in\n\n- Does the \u201cgroup\u201d picture help you see the numbers more clearly?  \n- If you get stuck, try drawing the groups on a piece of paper or using little objects (coins, beans, etc.) \u2013 the concrete view often clears the confusion.\n\nTake a moment, give the two answers, and we\u2019ll move forward together! \ud83d\ude80",
