Let\u2019s walk through this one together, slowly, clearly, and with care.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n\nWe are multiplying:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{6}{8}\n$$\n\n#### Step 1: Multiply the numerators  \n\ud83d\udc49 $2 \\times 6 = ?$  \nWe know:  \n- $2 \\times 6 = 12$  \n\u2705 So the new numerator is **12**\n\n#### Step 2: Multiply the denominators  \n\ud83d\udc49 $3 \\times 8 = ?$  \nWe know:  \n- $3 \\times 8 = 24$  \n\u2705 So the new denominator is **24**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Therefore, the new fraction is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{12}{24}\n$$\n\n#### Step 3: Simplify if possible  \nCan we simplify $ \\frac{12}{24} $?  \n- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12  \n- Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24  \n\u27a1\ufe0f Common factor: **12**  \n\u27a1\ufe0f Greatest common factor (GCF) = **12**\n\nDivide both numerator and denominator by 12:\n\n$$\n\\frac{12 \\div 12}{24 \\div 12} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n\u2705 Final answer: **$ \\frac{1}{2} $** \u2014 simplified!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Common Mistake Alert (again):\n\nYou said:  \n> \"I'm not sure.\"  \n\nThat\u2019s a *golden moment* to pause and build confidence. This is where many students get stuck \u2014 especially when the numbers look similar or when simplifying seems messy.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Don\u2019t rush** \u2014 just ask yourself:\n- Is this multiplication? \u2705 Yes \u2014 we multiply numerators and denominators.\n- Is $2 \\times 6 = 12$? \u2705 Yes  \n- Is $3 \\times 8 = 24$? \u2705 Yes  \n- Can we simplify $ \\frac{12}{24} $? \u2705 Yes \u2014 both divisible by 12\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Memory tip**:  \nYou can **cancel before multiplying** to make it easier! Let\u2019s try that here:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{6}{8}\n$$\n\nNotice:  \n- 2 and 8 \u2192 both divisible by 2  \n- 6 and 3 \u2192 both divisible by 3  \n\nSo, simplify step-by-step:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 \\div 2}{3 \\div 3} \\times \\frac{6 \\div 3}{8 \\div 2} = \\frac{1}{1} \\times \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{2}{4}\n$$\n\nNow simplify $ \\frac{2}{4} $ \u2192 divide by 2 \u2192 $ \\frac{1}{2} $\n\n\u2705 So, we get the same answer: **$ \\frac{1}{2} $** \u2014 and it was much easier with canceling!\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Powerful shortcut**: Canceling *before* multiplying saves time and reduces confusion \u2014 especially when numbers are large or close.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Key Takeaway:\n> To multiply fractions:  \n> 1. Multiply numerators: $2 \\times 6 = 12$  \n> 2. Multiply denominators: $3 \\times 8 = 24$  \n> 3. Simplify: $ \\frac{12}{24} = \\frac{1}{2} $\n\n> \ud83d\udd01 **Practice multiplication facts daily**, especially with 2, 3, 6, 8 \u2014 they come up often.  \n> \ud83d\udd01 **Say the facts out loud**:  \n> - $2 \\times 6 = 12$  \n> - $3 \\times 8 = 24$  \n> - $2 \\times 8 = 16$  \n> - $3 \\times 6 = 18$  \n> - $6 \\times 8 = 48$",
