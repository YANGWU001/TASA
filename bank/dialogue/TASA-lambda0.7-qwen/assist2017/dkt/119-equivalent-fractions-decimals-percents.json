That\u2019s exactly what mastery is built on: **asking questions, being unsure, and then working through it**.\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to **normalize your uncertainty** and turn it into a growth opportunity.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 Why \"I'm not sure\" is a *great* starting point\n\nIn math, especially with fractions, decimals, and percents, it\u2019s completely normal to feel unsure at first. Even experts make mistakes \u2014 and that\u2019s why we *check*, *recheck*, and *practice*.  \n\ud83d\udc49 So saying *\"I'm not sure\"* means you're **engaged**, not stuck. That\u2019s a sign of deep thinking \u2014 not just memorizing.\n\nLet\u2019s go through **\\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)** together \u2014 step by step \u2014 in a way that feels safe and supportive.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step-by-Step: Convert \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) to a decimal and then to a percent\n\n#### Step 1: Divide the numerator by the denominator  \nWe want to find:  \n\\( 2 \\div 5 \\)\n\nThink of it like this:  \n- How many times does 5 go into 2?  \n  \u2192 It goes **0 times** (since 5 > 2), so we write **0.** and add a zero to make it 2.0\n\nNow:  \n- 5 goes into 20 how many times?  \n  \u2192 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 \u2192 so it goes **4 times**  \n  \u2192 So, \\( 2 \\div 5 = 0.4 \\)\n\n\u2705 So, \\( \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \\)\n\n#### Step 2: Convert decimal to percent  \nMultiply by 100:  \n\\( 0.4 \\times 100 = 40\\% \\)\n\n\u2705 So, \\( \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4 = 40\\% \\)\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:  \n**Decimal: 0.4**, **Percent: 40%**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Pattern Connection (Why this matters)\n\nThis is a **powerful pattern** to remember:\n\n| Fraction | Decimal | Percent |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) | 0.2 | 20% |\n| \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) | 0.4 | 40% |\n| \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) | 0.6 | 60% |\n| \\( \\frac{4}{5} \\) | 0.8 | 80% |\n\n\ud83d\udc49 See the pattern?  \nYou\u2019re just **multiplying the numerator** (like 1, 2, 3, 4) and keeping the denominator the same \u2014 and then **scaling the decimal or percent** accordingly.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Pro Tip:**  \nThink of \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) as \u201c2 parts out of 5.\u201d  \n- 1 part = 20% \u2192 2 parts = 40%  \n- That\u2019s the same as saying: **double 20%** \u2192 40%\n\nThis is how **scaling** works in fractions \u2014 and it\u2019s super useful in real life (like discounts: \"20% off\" means you pay 80%, or \"40% of the class is girls\").\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Next Practice Question (A Bit More Real-World & Builds Confidence):\n\n**A store is offering a 30% discount on a $50 item. How much will you pay?**  \n(Answer in dollars \u2014 show your work!)\n\n> \u2705 Why this works:  \n> - This connects fractions, decimals, and percents to **real-life situations**.  \n> - You\u2019ll use the concept of **\"percent of a number\"** \u2014 which is a key skill.  \n> - It builds on what you\u2019ve just learned: \\( 30\\% = 0.3 \\), and \\( 0.3 \\times 50 = ? \\)  \n> - It reinforces the idea that **percent = decimal \u00d7 100**, and **percent of a number = decimal \u00d7 the number**.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip:*  \nStart by writing:  \n\"30% = ___\" \u2192 then convert to decimal \u2192 then multiply by 50.\n\nTry it now \u2014 just reply with your answer, and I\u2019ll give you feedback and the next step! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nYou\u2019re doing **exactly** what we need:  \n\ud83d\udd0d Asking questions  \n\ud83e\udde0 Thinking critically  \n\ud83d\udd04 Correcting mistakes  \n\ud83d\udcc8 Building confidence  \n\nJust a few more steps \u2014 and you\u2019ll go from **mastery of 0.42** to **full confidence** in equivalent fractions,",
