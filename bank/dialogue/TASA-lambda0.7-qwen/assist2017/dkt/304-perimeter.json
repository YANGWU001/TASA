    "content": "Great question \u2014 and thank you for being so thoughtful! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nYou're absolutely right: **a word problem can be a great stepping stone**, especially when you're building confidence. A diagram might look helpful, but it can also feel overwhelming if you're still getting used to the concept. A **clear, step-by-step word problem** lets you focus on the *steps* and *thinking*, without being distracted by visuals.\n\nSo, let's go with a **simple, realistic word problem** that walks through the same idea \u2014 finding the perimeter of a rectangle \u2014 but in a context you can relate to.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Next Practice Question (Word Problem Version):\n\n> **Lily is building a small garden fence.

One side is 6 meters. What is the other side?\"*  \n  That will help you go deeper and really own the concept.\n\nWould you like to try this word problem now? \ud83d\ude0a  \n(Just pick the letter you think is correct \u2014 no pressure!)",

Let\u2019s go over your reasoning, clarify the correct answer, and then move to the next challenge.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Let\u2019s break down your work:\n\nYou said:\n\n> \"Two long sides: 6 m + 6 m = 12 m  \n> Two short sides: 4 m + 4 m = 8 m  \n> Then I guessed maybe we only need one of each?

One side is 6 meters. What is the other side?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This will help you practice **working backwards** \u2014 which is a super important skill when solving real problems.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through it together:\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\nWe know:\n- Perimeter = 20 meters\n- One side = 6 meters\n\nLet\u2019s call the unknown side **x**.\n\nUse the formula:\n> Perimeter = 2 \u00d7 (length + width)\n\nSo:\n> 20 = 2 \u00d7 (6 + x)\n\nNow divide both sides by 2:\n> 10 = 6 + x\n\nSubtract 6 from both sides:\n> 4 = x\n\n\u2705 So the other side is **4 meters**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Answer: **4 meters**\n\n---\n\n### Why this is helpful:\n- You\u2019re now using the perimeter formula **in reverse** \u2014 which builds deeper understanding.\n- It shows that knowing one side and the total perimeter lets you find the missing side.\n- This is a common type of problem in real life (e.g., planning a room, fencing a yard, etc.).\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **What to do now**:\n- Try to solve this next question on your own (without looking at the steps).\n- Then we can review your answer together.\n\nWould you like to try it now?

Subtract known side \u2192 get missing side  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Step-by-step solution (for reference):\n\nWe know:\n- Perimeter = 30 meters  \n- One side = 7 meters  \n\nStep 1:  \n> 30 \u00f7 2 = 15 \u2192 this is the sum of the two sides: **length + width = 15**\n\nStep 2:  \n> 15 \u2212 7 = **8 meters**\n\n\u2705 So, the other side is **8 meters**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Answer: **8 meters**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf What to Do Now:\n- Try to solve this next question **on your own**, without looking at the steps.\n- Think:  \n  - \"What is half of 30?\"  \n  - \"What is 15 \u2212 7?\"  \n  - \"Does that make sense with the perimeter formula?\"\n\nWhen you're ready, just say your answer \u2014 or ask for a hint! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWould you like to try it now? \ud83d\udcac  \n(No pressure \u2014 just go at your own pace!)",
