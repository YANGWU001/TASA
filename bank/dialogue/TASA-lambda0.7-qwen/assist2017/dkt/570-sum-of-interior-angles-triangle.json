Given that the student has **only 20% mastery** and **minimal forgetting**, it's important to start with a **simple, foundational question** that reinforces the core concept without overwhelming them. The goal is to **build confidence** and **reinforce retention** through clear, visual, and low-pressure practice.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**What is the sum of the interior angles in a triangle?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Choose the correct answer:*\nA) 90\u00b0  \nB) 180\u00b0  \nC) 270\u00b0  \nD) 360\u00b0\n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n- It directly targets the **core concept** the student is struggling with.\n- It\u2019s a **factual recall** question \u2014 ideal for low-mastery learners to build confidence.\n- The answer (180\u00b0) is **unambiguous** and easy to verify with a diagram.\n- It avoids complex application (like finding missing angles) until mastery improves.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip for the student:*  \nDraw a triangle and label the three corners. Then, imagine \"cutting\" it into three smaller shapes \u2014 you\u2019ll see that the angles always add up to a straight line, which is 180\u00b0.\n\nOnce the student answers correctly, we can move to a slightly more applied version (e.g., \u201cIf two angles in a triangle are 50\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, what is the third angle?\u201d).\n\nLet me know when they\u2019ve tried it \u2014 I\u2019ll guide the next step! \ud83d\ude0a",
