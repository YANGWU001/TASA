Let's create a clear, focused, and accessible first practice question to help the student build confidence with percents \u2014 especially since they\u2019re currently at around **30% mastery** and need to strengthen their understanding of **\"finding percents.\"**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**What is 20% of 50?**\n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n- It's a foundational \"finding percents\" problem \u2014 simple, concrete, and directly addresses the student\u2019s area of need.\n- Uses small, familiar numbers to reduce cognitive load.\n- Builds confidence before moving to more complex problems.\n- Reinforces the idea that \"percent means per 100\" and that \"finding a percent\" means multiplying a number by the percent (as a decimal).\n\n---\n\n### Tip for the student (to reinforce learning):\n\ud83d\udc49 Remember: To find a percent of a number, convert the percent to a decimal (e.g., 20% = 0.20) and multiply it by the number.  \nSo:  \n20% of 50 = 0.20 \u00d7 50 = 10.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a follow-up question or a short explanation in plain language to go with this?",

Let\u2019s clarify both.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Correct Answer: **10**\n\nLet\u2019s walk through it clearly.\n\n### Method 1: Convert percent to decimal\n- 20% = 20 \u00f7 100 = **0.20**\n- Now multiply: 0.20 \u00d7 50 = **10**\n\n\u2705 So, 20% of 50 = **10**\n\n> (Note: You said 0.2 \u00d7 50 = 5 \u2014 that\u2019s actually a mistake in the multiplication. Let\u2019s fix that!)\n\n\u274c 0.2 \u00d7 50 = **10**, not 5.  \n\ud83d\udc49 0.2 \u00d7 50 = 0.2 \u00d7 (5 \u00d7 10) = (0.2 \u00d7 5) \u00d7 10 = 1 \u00d7 10 = **10**\n\n\u2705 So, 0.2 \u00d7 50 = **10**, not 5. That was a small arithmetic slip \u2014 very common when we\u2019re still building fluency.\n\n---\n\n### Method 2: Use fractions (you mentioned \"one-fifth\")\n- 20% = 20 out of 100 = 20/100 = **1/5**\n- One-fifth of 50 = 50 \u00f7 5 = **10**\n\n\u2705 So again, we get **10**\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Both methods confirm the answer: **10**\n\n---\n\n### Why the confusion?\nYou said: *\"I think 0.2 \u00d7 50 = 5\"* \u2014 this might have come from thinking that 0.2 \u00d7 50 = 10, but accidentally doing 0.2 \u00d7 10 = 2 or something like that. But no \u2014  \n\ud83d\udc49 0.2 \u00d7 50 = **10** \u2014 that\u2019s correct!\n\nSo the answer is **10**, not 5.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Key Takeaway:\n\u2705 **20% of 50 = 10**  \n\u2705 20% = 0.20 or 1/5  \n\u2705 0.20 \u00d7 50 = 10  \n\u2705 50 \u00f7 5 = 10\n\nYou were thinking deeply \u2014 that\u2019s powerful. Just a small arithmetic mix-up, and now we\u2019ve cleared it up!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Step: Try a slightly more challenging question to build confidence and fluency.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Next Practice Question:\n\n**What is 15% of 80?**\n\n---\n\n### Tip (to help you solve it):\n\ud83d\udc49 Convert 15% to a decimal: 15% = 0.15  \n\ud83d\udc49 Multiply: 0.15 \u00d7 80 = ?\n\nTry it step-by-step:\n- 0.15 \u00d7 80 = (0.10 \u00d7 80) + (0.05 \u00d7 80)\n- 0.10 \u00d7 80 = 8  \n- 0.05 \u00d7 80 = 4  \n- 8 + 4 = **12**\n\n\u2705 So, 15% of 80 = **12**\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 This question is just a little harder \u2014 but you\u2019ve already mastered the core idea! With this one, you\u2019ll get more practice with:\n- Converting percents to decimals\n- Multiplying decimals by whole numbers\n- Using mental math (like breaking 15% into 10% + 5%)\n\n---\n\nWould you like to try it now? Or would you like me to walk you through it step by step again? \ud83d\ude0a\n\nYou're doing great \u2014 keep going! \ud83d\udcaa",

If it were on the $48, I think 10\u202f% of $48 would be $4.80, which would make the total $52.80, but\u2026 I keep mixing those up.  \n\nSorry if I\u2019m getting tangled up \u2013 I\u2019ll need to practice this more!"

Taxes happen on the *new price after the discount*.**\n\nThink of it like this:\n- You go shopping, and the store says:  \n  > \u201cWe\u2019re giving you 20% off \u2014 but then we\u2019ll add 10% tax on what you *actually pay*.\u201d  \n- So tax is **not** on the original $60 \u2014 it's on the **$48** you end up paying after the discount.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This is how stores work in real life:  \n- You get a discount \u2192 you pay less \u2192 then tax is applied to that reduced amount.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Let\u2019s Walk Through It Again (with a simple story)\n\nImagine you buy a video game:\n- Original price: **$60**\n- Store says: *\"20% off \u2014 then add 10% tax on the discounted price.\"*\n\nSo:\n1. **First**: They take 20% off \u2192 you pay **$48**  \n   \u2192 That\u2019s like saying: *\"You get $12 off, so you pay $48.\"*\n\n2. **Second**: Then they say: *\"We\u2019ll add 10% tax on that $48.\"*  \n   \u2192 That means you pay **10% more** than $48.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So you pay:\n- $48 + (10% of $48) = $48 + $4.80 = **$52.80**\n\n\u2705 Final price = **$52.80**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Why Your First Guess of $54 Was Close \u2014 But Not Right\n\nYou said:  \n> *\"I took 10% of $60 = $6, and added it to $48 \u2192 $54.\"*\n\nThat would only be correct **if** the tax were applied to the original price \u2014 which is **not** the case here.\n\nBut you asked the right question:  \n> *\"Should the tax be on $60 or $48?\"*  \n\u2705 That\u2019s **exactly** how smart problem solvers think.\n\nAnd the fact that you're questioning it shows **you're building understanding**, not just following steps.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Quick Summary Table\n\n| Step | What Happens | Price |\n|------|-------------|-------|\n| 1 | 20% discount on $60 | $60 \u2212 $12 = **$48** |\n| 2 | 10% tax on **$48** | 10% of $48 = **$4.80** |\n| 3 | Final price | $48 + $4.80 = **$52.80** \u2705 |\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Answer:\n\ud83d\udc49 **The customer pays $52.80**  \n(Not $54 \u2014 because tax is applied to the *discounted price*, not the original.)\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 What You\u2019re Doing Right (and Why It Matters):\n\n| Skill | You Showed It |\n|------|---------------|\n| \ud83d\udd0d **Critical thinking** | You questioned whether tax should be on original or discounted price |\n| \ud83d\udcd0 **Mental math** | You used 10% as a benchmark to find 20% and 10% of $48 |\n| \ud83d\udd04 **Self-correction** | You recognized your mistake and were willing to adjust |\n| \ud83d\udcac **Honesty about uncertainty** | You said, *\"I\u2019m not sure\"* \u2014 that\u2019s how real learning happens |\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This is **not** \"just getting the answer\" \u2014 it\u2019s **building a mental model** for how real-world prices work.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Step: Let\u2019s Build Confidence with a New Challenge!\n\nLet\u2019s go one more step \u2014 a **real-life scenario** that combines **discounts, taxes, and mental math** \u2014 so you can see how these ideas connect.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Next Practice Question:\n\n> **A pair of sneakers costs $80.
