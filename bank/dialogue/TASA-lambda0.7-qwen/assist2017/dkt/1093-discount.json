Let's take it step by step \u2014 and keep it simple, clear, and friendly.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Step-by-Step Explanation (for the student):\n\nYou asked:  \n**\"A shirt originally costs $40. It is on sale for 25% off. What is the sale price of the shirt?\"**\n\nLet\u2019s break it down in a way that\u2019s easy to understand:\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 1: What does \u201c25% off\u201d mean?\n- \u201c25% off\u201d means you **save 25% of the original price**.\n- So, you don\u2019t pay the full $40 \u2014 you pay **only 75%** of it (because 100% \u2013 25% = 75%).\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Think of it like this:  \nIf the shirt was $100, 25% off would mean you save $25, and pay $75.  \nSo, 25% off = you pay **75% of the original price**.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 2: What is 75% of $40?\nWe need to find **75% of 40**.\n\nTo do that:\n- Convert 75% to a decimal:  \n  \u2192 75% = 75 \u00f7 100 = **0.75**\n- Multiply:  \n  \u2192 0.75 \u00d7 40 = **30**\n\n\u2705 So, the sale price is **$30**.\n\n#### \u2705 Final Answer: **$30**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Now, let\u2019s check your understanding:\n\n> \u201cCan you explain in your own words how you found the sale price?\u201d  \n> *(Try to say it like you\u2019re teaching someone else.)*\n\nFor example:  \n> \u201cI took 25% off, so I found 75% of $40 because 100% minus 25% is 75%. Then I multiplied 0.75 by 40 and got $30.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you say something like that, great! You\u2019re building the right understanding.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Next Question (to build confidence and reinforce the concept):\n\n**A pair of shoes costs $80. There\u2019s a 30% discount. What is the sale price?**\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip:  \n- First, figure out what percent you **pay** (100% \u2013 30% = 70%)  \n- Then, calculate 70% of $80  \n- You can do this by multiplying 0.70 \u00d7 80\n\nTry solving it on your own \u2014 and then tell me your answer or how you found it! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready to go through it together. \ud83d\udcaa",
