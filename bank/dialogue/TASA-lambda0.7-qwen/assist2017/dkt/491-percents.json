    "content": "Great question \u2014 and thank you for being honest! \ud83d\ude0a  \nYou're absolutely right to want to understand it step by step. Let's go through **why 5 might be a good guess**, and then **exactly how to find 20% of 50** with confidence.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Explanation: What is 20% of 50?\n\nLet\u2019s break it down using the **definition of percent**:\n\n> \ud83d\udd0d **Percent means \"per 100\"**  \n> So, **20% = 20 out of 100**  \n> That means:  \n> 20% = 20 \u00f7 100 = 0.20\n\nNow, to find **20% of 50**, we multiply:\n\n> 20% of 50 = 0.20 \u00d7 50\n\nLet\u2019s do that:\n\n> 0.20 \u00d7 50 = **10**\n\n\u2705 So, **20% of 50 is 10**, not 5.\n\nBut why did you think 5? That\u2019s actually a really smart guess \u2014 maybe because:\n- 10% of 50 is 5 (since 10% = 10 \u00f7 100 = 0.10 \u2192 0.10 \u00d7 50 = 5)\n- So, 20% is **twice as much** as 10%, which means 2 \u00d7 5 = **10**\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **That\u2019s a great pattern to remember!**  \n\ud83d\udc49 *10% of a number = divide it by 10*  \n\ud83d\udc49 *20% of a number = double that (10%)*\n\nSo, if 10% of 50 is 5 \u2192 then 20% of 50 is **10**.\n\n\u2705 Final answer: **10**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Now, let\u2019s build on this with a slightly more challenging but still manageable question:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Next Practice Question:\n\n**What is 15% of 60?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint: First find 10% of 60, then add half of that (since 15% = 10% + 5%)*\n\n---\n\n### Why this next question?\n- Builds on the same concept: finding a percentage of a number.\n- Introduces **15%**, which is a common \"in-between\" percent (between 10% and 20%).\n- Uses the **same strategy** (10% + 5%) to help reinforce pattern recognition.\n- Still uses small, familiar numbers (60) to keep it accessible.\n- Encourages **mental math** and **pattern recognition**, which helps with long-term retention.\n\nAfter this, we can gradually introduce word problems or reverse problems (like \u201cWhat percent of 40 is 8?\u201d) as mastery grows.\n\nWould you like to try the next one now? \ud83d\ude0a  \n(You\u2019ve got this \u2014 you\u2019re already thinking like a pro!) \ud83d\udcaa",
