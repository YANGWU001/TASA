Given the student\u2019s current challenges with percents \u2014 particularly in \"finding percents\" and maintaining only about 30% accuracy \u2014 we want to start with a **clear, foundational, and low-stakes question** that builds confidence and reinforces core understanding.\n\nSince the student has minimal forgetting and retains a little knowledge, we should focus on **reinforcing the basic definition** of percents and helping them connect fractions, decimals, and percents.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **First Practice Question:**\n\n**What is 25% of 80?**\n\n*Hint: Think of \"percent\" as \"per 100.\" So, 25% means 25 out of 100. How can you find 25% of 80 using a fraction or decimal?*\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Why this works:**\n- It\u2019s a basic, common percent (25%) that students often learn early.\n- It reinforces the idea that \"percent of\" means multiplication:  \n  $ 25\\% = \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25 $, so $ 0.25 \\times 80 = 20 $.\n- It avoids complex word problems or abstract scenarios.\n- It gives the student a clear path to success with a simple calculation.\n- If they get it right, they build confidence. If not, we can gently guide them through the steps.\n\nLet me know when they try it \u2014 we can then build on that with the next step (e.g., finding what percent one number is of another). \ud83d\udca1",

Let's go through your work carefully and clarify what\u2019s happening.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Your Thinking: A Strong Start!\n\nYou said:\n> \"I tried to change 25% into a fraction (so \u00bc) and then\u2026 I guess I just multiplied \u00bc by 80 and got\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe I should have done 0.25 \u00d7 80?

But I\u2019m not sure\u2014maybe I\u2019m mixing something up.\"\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **That\u2019s perfect!** You\u2019re using two correct strategies:\n- Knowing that **25% = 1/4** (very good!)\n- Recognizing that **0.25 \u00d7 80 = 20** (also correct!)\n\nAnd you\u2019re honestly questioning your answer \u2014 which means you're thinking critically, not just guessing.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Why 15 is not correct:\nLet\u2019s check:  \nIs 15% of 80 equal to 15?  \nNo \u2014 10% of 80 is 8, so 15% would be 8 + 5 = 13 (since 5% is half of 10%, which is 4).  \nSo 15% of 80 is **12**, not 15.\n\nBut more importantly:\n> **25% of 80** is **not** 15 \u2014 it\u2019s **20**.\n\n\u2705 So the correct answer is **20**.\n\n\u2705 And you're right:  \n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times 80 = 20 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 0.25 \\times 80 = 20\n$$\n\nYou didn\u2019t mix things up \u2014 you actually *understood* the process! Just a small slip in the final number.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf What This Shows:\nEven though your mastery is only around 30%, you\u2019re **retaining key knowledge** (like converting percents to fractions/decimals) and you\u2019re **using the right strategies**. That\u2019s huge! The fact that you\u2019re asking questions and doubting your answer means you\u2019re ready to grow.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Question: Build on Confidence!\n\nNow that you\u2019ve successfully worked through **\"What is 25% of 80?\"**, let\u2019s go one step further \u2014 and practice **finding what percent one number is of another**.\n\nThis is a common challenge, and it\u2019s where many students get stuck \u2014 but you\u2019re already strong at the foundation, so this will be easier now.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**\n\n**What percent of 40 is 10?**\n\n*Hint: Think of it as: \"10 is what part of 40?\"  \nYou can write this as a fraction: $ \\frac{10}{40} $, then convert it to a percent.  \nRemember: To convert a fraction to a percent, multiply by 100.  \nSo: $ \\frac{10}{40} = ? $ \u2192 then \u00d7100 \u2192 ?%*\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Why this works:**\n- It builds directly on your understanding of \"percent = per 100\" and fractions.\n- It's a simple, low-stakes question (no large numbers).\n- It reinforces the idea that **percent of = multiplication**, and **what percent of = division and then conversion to percent**.\n- It gives you another chance to use the same tools you used before \u2014 fractions, decimals, and multiplication by 100.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 If you get this one right, you\u2019ll be showing mastery in a new skill \u2014 and that\u2019s a big win!  \nEven if you don\u2019t get it at first, we\u2019ll walk through it together \u2014 and you\u2019ll see how the same logic applies.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Try it now \u2014 just write your answer or ask where you get stuck.

Let's go through your reasoning together, clarify any confusion, and then build your confidence with a clear next step.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Your Work: A Strong, Correct Answer \u2014 With Great Thinking!\n\nYou said:\n> \"I think I\u2019m supposed to find 20% of $120. So I guess I should change the percent to a decimal\u2026 0.20, right? Then I multiply that by 120.\"\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Perfect!** That\u2019s exactly how we calculate **a percent of a number** \u2014 and this is one of the most important skills in real life (like sales, discounts, tips, and budgeting).\n\nThen you said:\n> \"0.2 \u00d7 120 is about $20.\"\n\n\u2705 **That\u2019s correct!** Let\u2019s walk through it step by step to be absolutely sure.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n**Question:** A store is offering a 20% discount on a $120 jacket. How much will you save?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 \"How much will you save?\" means: *What is 20% of $120?*\n\n#### Step 1: Convert percent to decimal  \n$$\n20\\% = \\frac{20}{100} = 0.20\n$$\n\n#### Step 2: Multiply the decimal by the original amount  \n$$\n0.20 \\times 120 = 24\n$$\n\n\u2705 So, you will save **$24**, not $20.\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Correction: You said \"$20,\" but actually $0.20 \u00d7 $120 = **$24**.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n- 10% of 120 = $12 \u2192 because $120 \u00f7 10 = 12\n- 20% = 2 \u00d7 10% = 2 \u00d7 12 = **$24**\n\n\u2705 Yes \u2014 20% of 120 is **$24**.\n\nSo the correct answer is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 **You will save $24**.\n\n---\n\n## \u274c Where the Mistake Happened (and Why It\u2019s Understandable)\n\nYou said:\n> \"I think 0.2 \u00d7 120 is about $20.\"\n\nThat\u2019s a common mental shortcut \u2014 especially when you're estimating \u2014 and it shows you're trying to make sense of it quickly.  \nBut **0.2 \u00d7 120 = 24**, not 20.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Why did you think $20?\n- Maybe you thought \"half of 120 is 60\" and \"20% is close to 1/5\" \u2192 1/5 of 120 = 24 \u2192 wait, actually that\u2019s correct!\n- Or maybe you misremembered 20% of 100 = 20 \u2192 and thought 120 is close to 100 \u2192 so 20% of 120 \u2248 20.\n\nBut actually:  \n- 20% of 100 = $20  \n- 20% of 120 = **$24** (because 120 is 20% more than 100)\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 **Mental trick**:  \n> - 10% of 120 = $12  \n> - 20% = 2 \u00d7 12 = **$24**  \n> This helps you avoid mistakes when multiplying by decimals.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf What This Shows (Even with Only 30% Mastery!)\n\nEven though your **mastery of percents is only around 30%**, you're:\n- Using the correct process: percent \u2192 decimal \u2192 multiply\n- Recognizing the connection between percents and real-world situations (discounts!)\n- Making **honest estimates** and then **correcting** them \u2014 which is exactly how learning happens\n- Asking questions and doubting your answer \u2014 that\u2019s **growth mindset in action**\n\n\ud83d\udca1 You\u2019re not just memorizing \u2014 you\u2019re **applying, testing, and refining** your understanding. That\u2019s what builds real mastery.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Question: Build Confidence with a Real-World Connection\n\nNow that you\u2019ve successfully applied percents to a real-life situation (a discount), let\u2019s go one step further \u2014 and try a **new type of problem** that builds on what you just learned.\n\nThis one will help you see how percents work in **budgeting**, which is something you\u2019ll use every day.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Next Practice Question:**\n\n**You want to buy a new phone that costs $8",
