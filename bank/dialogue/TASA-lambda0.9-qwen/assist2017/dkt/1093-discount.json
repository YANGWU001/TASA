    "content": "Absolutely! Given the student\u2019s current mastery of **discount** is only about **20%** with **moderate forgetting (score 0.22)**, the first practice question should be:\n\n\u2705 **Simple, foundational**  \n\u2705 **Familiar and concrete** (to rebuild confidence)  \n\u2705 **Focused on core concept** (e.g., finding the discounted price after a percentage is applied)  \n\u2705 **Low cognitive load** (no extra steps or distractions)  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc First Practice Question:\n\n**A shirt originally costs $40. It is on sale for 25% off. What is the sale price of the shirt?**\n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n- Builds on basic percentage knowledge (25% of 40).\n- Avoids complex scenarios (like multiple discounts or taxes).\n- Reinforces the concept of \"discount\" as a reduction from original price.\n- Provides a clear path to answer:  \n  \u2192 Find 25% of $40 \u2192 Subtract from $40.\n\nThis small step helps rebuild confidence and corrects the gap in foundational understanding. After this, we can gradually introduce more complex problems.\n\nWould you like a follow-up question or explanation guide to go with this?",
