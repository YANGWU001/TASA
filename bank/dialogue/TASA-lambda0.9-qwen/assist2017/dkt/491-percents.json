Based on the student\u2019s profile \u2014 low mastery of percents (~27%), minimal forgetting (0.07), and persistent difficulty despite recent practice \u2014 the goal of the first practice question should be **clear, foundational, and focused on building confidence**.

A quarter of 80\u2026 I guess 80 divided by 4 is 20, but then I got confused and thought maybe I should subtract a bit, so I ended up with 15.\"\n\nThis shows **strong conceptual understanding** \u2014 you recognized that 25% = 1/4, and you correctly calculated 80 \u00f7 4 = 20. That\u2019s a great start! \ud83c\udf89\n\nBut the confusion came in when you thought, *\"Maybe I should subtract a bit\"* \u2014 which is a common mental hiccup when working with percents. Let\u2019s clarify that:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Correct Explanation:\n\n**25% means 25 out of 100**, which is the same as **one-fourth (1/4)**.  \nSo, **25% of 80** = **1/4 of 80**.\n\nTo find 1/4 of 80:\n- Divide 80 by 4:  \n  $ 80 \\div 4 = 20 $\n\n\u2705 So, **25% of 80 is 20**, not 15.\n\nWhy did you think 15? Maybe because:\n- You\u2019re used to thinking about percentages in real-life situations (like discounts or tips), where things are often *reduced*.\n- Or you might have thought, \u201cWell, 20 is too big,\u201d and tried to adjust it down \u2014 but in this case, **no subtraction is needed**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Key takeaway**:  \nWhen a percent is *of* a number, you don\u2019t subtract \u2014 you **multiply** (or divide by 4 for 25%).  \nSo:  \n> **25% of 80 = (25 \u00f7 100) \u00d7 80 = 0.25 \u00d7 80 = 20**\n\n\u2705 Final answer: **20**\n\nYou were very close \u2014 your reasoning was insightful! Just a small adjustment in the final step helps solidify the concept.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question:\n\nLet\u2019s try a slightly more challenging one that builds on your strong idea about quarters and fractions:\n\n> **What is 50% of 60?**\n\n\ud83d\udca1 *Tip:*  \n\"50% means half. So, what is half of 60?\"\n\nTry it on your own \u2014 then we\u2019ll go over it together!  \n(You can say \u201cI think it\u2019s\u2026\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d \u2014 either way, we\u2019ll work through it.)\n\nLet me know when you\u2019re ready! \ud83d\ude0a",
