Given that the student is struggling with **fraction multiplication** and has a high forgetting score (\u22480.42), indicating significant knowledge loss despite recent practice, it\u2019s important to start with a **clear, foundational, and low-pressure** question that reinforces the core concept in a way that builds confidence.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Goal of the First Practice Question:\n- Focus on **basic fraction multiplication** (same denominators or simple numerators/denominators).\n- Emphasize **conceptual clarity** over speed.\n- Use **concrete numbers** to reduce cognitive load.\n- Reinforce the rule: *\"Multiply numerators, multiply denominators.\"*\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**What is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\)?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Step-by-step hint:*  \nMultiply the numerators (2 \u00d7 4) and multiply the denominators (3 \u00d7 5).
