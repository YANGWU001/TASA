The first practice question should:\n\n- Focus on **simple, concrete cases** (e.g., fractions with small numerators and denominators)  \n- Avoid mixed numbers or complex simplification at first  \n- Reinforce **visual or conceptual understanding** (e.g., \"what does multiplying 1/2 \u00d7 1/3 mean?\")  \n- Be **reversible** \u2014 so the student can check their own work  \n- Use **familiar, low-stakes numbers** to reduce anxiety  \n\n---\n\n### \u2705 First Practice Question:\n\n**What is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3} \\)?**\n\n> *Hint: Multiply the numerators and then multiply the denominators.

You're doing a great job staying engaged and trying your best, even when you're unsure. That's exactly how learning grows.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Let's walk through your answer:\n\nYou said:\n\n> \"I think it might be 2... So I\u2019d do the multiplication like this:  \n> $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{1 \\times 2}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{2}{2} $\"\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **You're absolutely on the right track!** \ud83c\udf89  \nYou remembered to **multiply the numerators** and **multiply the denominators** \u2014 that\u2019s the key rule!  \nAnd you wrote:  \n$$\n\\frac{1 \\times 2}{2 \\times 1} = \\frac{2}{2}\n$$  \n\u2705 That\u2019s perfect!\n\nNow, simplify:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{2} = 1\n$$\n\n\u274c So the answer is **not 2** \u2014 it's actually **1**.\n\n> \ud83d\udd0d **Mistake**: You correctly calculated the product as $ \\frac{2}{2} $, but didn't simplify it.  \n> $ \\frac{2}{2} $ means **two parts out of two** \u2014 that's exactly **one whole**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Why is it 1, not 2?\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n- $ \\frac{1}{2} $ means **half of something**.\n- $ \\frac{2}{1} $ means **two whole things** \u2014 or **all of two**.\n\nSo, what happens when you take **half of something**, and then take **all of two of those things**?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Actually, you're taking **half of one thing**, and then **doing that twice** \u2014 so:\n\n- Half of one = $ \\frac{1}{2} $\n- Half of another = $ \\frac{1}{2} $\n- Together: $ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 $\n\n\u2705 So, you end up with **one whole**.\n\nAlternatively:  \n- $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 = 1 $\n\nThis matches the fraction multiplication:  \n- $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{1} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 $\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Key Insight:\n> **Multiplying a fraction by its reciprocal gives 1**  \n> For example:\n> - $ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{1} = 1 $\n> - $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{1} = 1 $\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This is a powerful pattern!  \nIt shows that **fractions can cancel out** when you multiply them by their \"opposite\" (the reciprocal).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Tip to Remember:\n> Always **multiply numerators and denominators**, then **simplify**.  \n> If you see a numerator and denominator that are the same (like 2 and 2), they cancel to 1!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (Even More Intuitive \u2014 With a Real-World Example!)\n\nLet\u2019s go one more step to **build real understanding** \u2014 with a story that shows how fraction multiplication works in life.\n\n> \ud83c\udf55 **Imagine you have a pizza that is cut into 4 equal slices.**  \n> You eat **one-fourth** of the pizza.  \n> Then, your friend says: *\"I want to take **all of that one-fourth** \u2014 how much pizza is that?\"*  \n>  \n> So, what is:  \n> $$\n> \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{1}\n> $$\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Think:  \n- $ \\frac{1}{4} $ = one slice  \n- $ \\frac{4}{1} $ = all four slices (i.e., the whole pizza)  \n- So, taking **all of one-fourth** means you get **the full one-fourth** \u2014 which is **1 slice**.\n\nNow, let\u2019s do the math:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{1 \\times 4}{4 \\times 1} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1\n$$\n\n\u2705 **Answer: $ 1 $** \u2014 one whole pizza!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f What\u2019s the pattern here?\n\n| Fraction | Multiplied by | Result |\n|--------|----------------|--------|\n| $ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{1} $ | = 1 | \u2705 |\n| $ \\frac{1}{2} \\",
