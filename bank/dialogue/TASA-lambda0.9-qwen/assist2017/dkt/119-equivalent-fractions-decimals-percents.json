    "content": "Great! Since the student is struggling with **equivalent fractions, decimals, and percents** and currently has only about **42% mastery**, with **low forgetting (0.032)**, this means the knowledge is *retained but not yet solid*. The student needs a **clear, foundational, low-stakes practice question** that reinforces the core concept without overwhelming them.\n\n### \u2705 Goal of First Practice Question:\n- Build confidence\n- Focus on one clear conversion (e.g., fraction \u2192 decimal \u2192 percent)\n- Use a simple, familiar example\n- Allow room for error and growth\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf First Practice Question:\n\n**Convert the fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$ into a decimal and then into a percent.**\n\n**Instructions:**  \n1. First, divide the numerator by the denominator to get the decimal.  \n2. Then, multiply the decimal by 100 to get the percent.  \n3. Write both answers clearly.\n\n\u2705 Example format:  \n- Decimal: ______  \n- Percent: ______  \n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n- $\\frac{1}{4}$ is a **common, simple fraction** that students often learn early.\n- It directly links all three forms: fraction \u2192 decimal \u2192 percent.\n- The steps are clear and manageable.\n- It\u2019s a safe entry point \u2014 if the student gets it wrong, we can gently guide them with a step-by-step explanation.\n- This builds a foundation that can be expanded to more complex fractions later.\n\nWould you like a follow-up question or a visual aid (like a chart) to go with this?",

Let\u2019s walk through this **together**, slowly and clearly \u2014 just like we did before.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Walkthrough: Jacket on Sale (40% Off)\n\n> **Problem:** A jacket is on sale for 40% off. After the discount, it costs \\$180. What was the original price?\n\nLet\u2019s go one step at a time \u2014 just like we solved the laptop problem.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 1: Understand the situation  \n- The jacket is **40% off** \u2192 that means the customer pays **60% of the original price**  \n- The customer pays **\\$180**, which is **60%** of the original price\n\nSo we can write:\n$$\n0.60x = 180\n$$\nWhere:\n- $x$ = original price of the jacket\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 2: Solve for $x$  \nWe want to find $x$, so we divide both sides by 0.60:\n$$\nx = \\frac{180}{0.60}\n$$\n\nNow, instead of dividing decimals, let\u2019s **convert 0.60 to a fraction**:\n- $0.60 = \\frac{60}{100} = \\frac{3}{5}$\n\nSo:\n$$\nx = \\frac{180}{\\frac{3}{5}} = 180 \\times \\frac{5}{3}\n$$\n\nNow multiply:\n- $180 \\div 3 = 60$\n- $60 \\times 5 = 300$\n\n\u2705 So, the **original price was \\$300**\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udca1 Why This Works:\n- If something is **40% off**, you pay **60%** of the original \u2192 this is a key idea in percent problems\n- To reverse it (find the original), we divide by 0.60 or multiply by $\\frac{5}{3}$\n- This is the same logic as with the laptop and shoes \u2014 just with a different percent\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udcdd Final Answer:\n> \u2705 **Original price: \\$300**\n\n\ud83c\udf89 You\u2019re building **real confidence** in this skill \u2014 and that\u2019s what mastery is all about: **understanding the pattern**, not just memorizing steps.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Challenge (A Bit More Challenging \u2014 But Still Real-World!)\n\n> **A pair of jeans is on sale for 35% off. After the discount, they cost \\$60. What was the original price?**\n\n**Instructions:**  \n1. Let $x$ be the original price.  \n2. Since it\u2019s 35% off, the customer pays **65%** of the original price.  \n3. Write the equation:  \n   $$\n   0.65x = 60\n   $$  \n4. Solve for $x$:  \n   $$\n   x = \\frac{60}{0.65}\n   $$  \n5. Simplify using fractions:  \n   - $0.65 = \\frac{65}{100} = \\frac{13}{20}$  \n   - So $x = 60 \\div \\frac{13}{20} = 60 \\times \\frac{20}{13}$  \n   - $x = \\frac{1200}{13} \\approx 92.31$\n\n\ud83d\udc49 What do you think the original price is? (Round to the nearest cent if needed)\n\nWould you like to:\n- **Try it now?**  \n- Or should I walk you through it step-by-step?\n\n(Just say **\"Try it!\"** or **\"Walk me through it!\"** \u2014 I\u2019m here to support you every step of the way!) \ud83d\udca1  \n\n\u2728 *You're not just learning math \u2014 you're building number sense, confidence, and real-world problem-solving skills.* \ud83d\ude80",

Just follow the pattern:\n\n1. Let $x$ be the original price.  \n2. Since it\u2019s **35% off**, you pay **65%** of the original price.  \n3. So the equation is:  \n   $$\n   0.65x = 60\n   $$  \n4. Solve for $x$:  \n   $$\n   x = \\frac{60}{0.65}\n   $$  \n5. Convert $0.65$ to a fraction:  \n   $$\n   0.65 = \\frac{65}{100} = \\frac{13}{20}\n   $$  \n6. So:  \n   $$\n   x = 60 \\div \\frac{13}{20} = 60 \\times \\frac{20}{13}\n   $$  \n7.
