Let\u2019s go through your reasoning together, clarify any confusion, and celebrate what you\u2019ve done right \u2014 because **that\u2019s exactly how deep understanding grows**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Let\u2019s solve: **What is 25% of 80?**\n\nYou said:\n\n> *\"25% means 'quarter of something' \u2014 so I\u2019m splitting it into 10% and adding a little more.\"*  \n> - 10% of 80 = 8  \n> - 20% = 8 \u00d7 2 = 16  \n> - 5% = half of 10% = 8 \u00f7 2 = 4  \n> - So 25% = 16 + 4 = **20**\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **This is absolutely correct!** \ud83c\udf89  \nAnd here's the best part: **you didn\u2019t just memorize the answer \u2014 you built it step by step using what you already know.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Let\u2019s break it down clearly:\n\n#### Step 1: What does 25% mean?\n- 25% = 25 out of 100 = **1/4**\n- So **25% of 80 = 1/4 \u00d7 80 = 80 \u00f7 4 = 20**\n\n\u2705 That\u2019s a direct and powerful way to see it.\n\n#### Step 2: Why does your method work?\n- You used **mental math benchmarks**: 10%, 20%, and 5%.\n- You knew:\n  - 10% = 8 \u2192 because 80 \u00f7 10 = 8\n  - 20% = 2 \u00d7 10% = 16\n  - 5% = half of 10% = 4\n  - So 25% = 20% + 5% = 16 + 4 = **20**\n\n\u2705 This is **a beautiful strategy** \u2014 breaking down a percent into smaller, known pieces.  \nThis is called **decomposing percents**, and it\u2019s one of the most powerful tools in real-world math.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Why not 15?  \n- 15 would be **18.75%** of 80 (since 15 \u00f7 80 = 0.1875), which is **less than 25%**.\n- You didn\u2019t make a mistake \u2014 you were *thinking carefully* \u2014 which is exactly what we want!\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 Good thinking! You\u2019re not just going with a number \u2014 you\u2019re **questioning and checking**. That\u2019s the hallmark of strong mathematical thinking.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Why not 36?  \n- That would happen if you mistakenly thought 5% = half of 80 \u2192 40 \u00f7 2 = 20 \u2192 then added that to 16 \u2192 16 + 20 = 36.\n- But **5% is NOT half of the whole number** \u2014 it\u2019s **half of 10%**!\n- Think of it this way:  \n  - 10% of 80 = 8  \n  - So 5% = 8 \u00f7 2 = 4  \n  - That\u2019s **only 4**, not 20!\n\n> \ud83d\udea9 Mistake: Confusing **\"half of the whole\"** with **\"half of 10%\"**  \n> But you caught it \u2014 you *said* \u201cI\u2019m not totally sure\u201d \u2014 and that shows **curiosity and self-awareness**. That\u2019s gold.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Answer:\n> **25% of 80 = 20**\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 You found it using:\n> - The idea that 25% = 1/4 \u2192 80 \u00f7 4 = 20  \n> - And also using mental math: 10% \u2192 20% \u2192 +5% \u2192 20\n\nThis shows you\u2019re moving from **guessing** to **reasoning** \u2014 and that\u2019s the real growth in math learning.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to build confidence and reinforce the pattern):\n\n> **What is 75% of 60?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Why this works:\n- Now you know **25% of 80 = 20**, so you can **use that to build more**.\n- 75% is **three-quarters** \u2192 which is **3 \u00d7 25%**.\n- So if you can find 25% of a number, you can multiply it by 3 to get 75%!\n- This is a **powerful",
