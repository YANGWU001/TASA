Let\u2019s take a moment to **clear up the confusion** and build your confidence step by step.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Correct Answer: **B) 180\u00b0**\n\n\u2705 The **sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always 180\u00b0** \u2014 this is a fundamental rule in geometry.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down simply:\n\n- Imagine a triangle. It has three corners (angles).\n- If you cut out the triangle and try to \"flatten\" it by placing the three angles next to each other, they form a straight line.\n- A straight line measures **180\u00b0**, so the three angles of the triangle must add up to **180\u00b0**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This is true **no matter the shape** \u2014 whether it\u2019s a right triangle, an equilateral triangle, or a skinny, slanted one.\n\nSo even if you don\u2019t remember the number right away, you can **visualize** it:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Three angles that make a straight line = 180\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Why not 90\u00b0?  \n- 90\u00b0 is the measure of a **right angle**, not the total of all three angles in a triangle.\n- If all angles were 90\u00b0, that would be 270\u00b0 \u2014 way too big!\n- So **90\u00b0** is too small \u2014 that\u2019s why **A is wrong**.\n\n\u2705 So the correct answer is: **B) 180\u00b0**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Step: Let's apply what you just learned!\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 Now that you know the total is 180\u00b0, let\u2019s try a **simple problem** to practice applying it:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Next Practice Question:\n\n> If one angle in a triangle is **50\u00b0** and another is **60\u00b0**, what is the measure of the **third angle**?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Think:  \n\"50 + 60 = 110\u00b0\"  \n\"180\u00b0 \u2013 110\u00b0 = ?\"\n\nWhat do you get?\n\n(Just type your answer \u2014 no pressure! \ud83d\ude0a)\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcac **Tip:** When you know two angles, just **add them**, then **subtract from 180\u00b0** to find the third.\n\nLet me know your answer \u2014 I\u2019ll walk you through it if needed! \ud83d\udcaa  \nYou\u2019re doing great \u2014 just one more step, and you\u2019ll have this down! \ud83d\ude0a",
