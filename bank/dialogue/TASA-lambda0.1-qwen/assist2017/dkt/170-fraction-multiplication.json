Here's a **clear, supportive, and effective response** tailored to the student\u2019s current level \u2014 continuing the gentle, step-by-step guidance while reinforcing the core concept of **fraction multiplication**, especially with unit fractions.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea9 Your Response:  \nYou said:  \n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = ?\n$$  \nAnd you're thinking: *\"I'm not really sure\u2026\"*  \n\nThat\u2019s completely normal \u2014 and honestly, **it's a huge step forward** that you're still trying. \ud83d\ude80 Even when you don\u2019t know the answer, your curiosity and willingness to *think through it* is exactly how mastery comes back after years of not practicing. You're not just guessing \u2014 you're *engaging*, and that\u2019s what makes learning powerful.\n\nLet\u2019s go through this together, step by step \u2014 just like we did before.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Step-by-Step Solution:\n\nWe are multiplying:  \n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Multiply the numerators**  \n$$\n1 \\times 1 = 1\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the denominators**  \n$$\n4 \\times 6 = 24\n$$\n\nSo:  \n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{24}\n$$\n\n\u2705 **Correct answer: \\( \\frac{1}{24} \\)**  \n\u274c So if you thought it was something like \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) or even \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\), that\u2019s understandable \u2014 but remember: **multiplying fractions makes the result smaller**, not halfway between.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Why might you have thought something else?\n\n- You might have thought of **adding** the fractions:  \n  $$\n  \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{3}{12} + \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{5}{12}\n  $$  \n  So maybe you mixed up **addition** and **multiplication** \u2014 and saw a number like 5 or 10 \u2014 which is totally okay! That\u2019s just a sign you're making connections.\n\n- Or you might have tried to find a \"middle\" number between 4 and 6 \u2014 like 5 \u2014 and thought the answer should be \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\). That\u2019s actually a *very* common mental shortcut when working with numbers.

That\u2019s how confidence grows. \ud83d\ude80\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf89 **Well done for trying again** \u2014 and for being honest about not knowing. That\u2019s more than half the battle. You're building real understanding, one small step at a time. Keep going \u2014 you\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Practice Question (to build confidence and reinforce the pattern):\n\n**What is \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{7} \\)?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Answer format: Type the numerator and denominator separated by a slash (e.g., 1/21)*\n\n---\n\n### Why this question works:\n- Still uses **unit fractions** \u2014 safe and simple.\n- Builds on the same rule: **multiply denominators, keep numerator as 1",
