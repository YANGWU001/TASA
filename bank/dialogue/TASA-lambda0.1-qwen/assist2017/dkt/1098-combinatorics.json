That means:\n- The first letter must be **A**\n- The second must be **H**\n- The third must be **M**\n- The fourth must be **T**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 There\u2019s **only one** way to arrange the letters of \"MATH\" in alphabetical order.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:  \n> \u2705 **1 way**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Why not 4?\n\nYou might be thinking: \"There are 4 letters, so maybe 4 ways?\"  \nBut that would be true if there were **no restrictions** \u2014 like in a regular permutation of 4 letters.\n\nFor 4 distinct letters, the total number of arrangements (permutations) is:  \n$$\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n$$\n\nSo yes, there are 24 *total* arrangements \u2014 but the question is **not** asking for all of them.\n\nIt\u2019s asking: **How many arrangements are in alphabetical order?**\n\nAnd the answer is:  \n\ud83d\udc49 Only **one** arrangement satisfies that condition.\n\nThink of it like this:  \nIf you were sorting a deck of cards, only one way would be completely sorted from A to Z.  \nSimilarly, only one arrangement of A, H, M, T is in alphabetical order.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda Key Takeaway (Pattern Recognition!)\n> \u26a0\ufe0f **Constraint = Limits the number of valid options**  \n> \u2705 In this case, the constraint \"must be in alphabetical order\" reduces the number of valid arrangements from 24 to just **1**.\n\nThis is a fundamental idea in combinatorics:  \n\ud83d\udd39 **We count only the arrangements that satisfy a given condition** \u2014 and sometimes, that condition limits us to just one!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Follow-up Prompt (to deepen understanding):\n\n> \"If we removed the alphabetical order rule, how many total arrangements would there be? What if we only required the first letter to be A \u2014 how many arrangements would that give us?\"\n\nThis helps you practice **pattern recognition** and **counting under different rules**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (Slightly Harder \u2013 Still Accessible)\n\nLet\u2019s move to a new problem that builds on the pattern we just saw:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Second Practice Question (Combinatorics \u2013 Pattern Finding)\n\n**Q:**  \nHow many ways can you arrange the letters in the word **\"CAT\"** if the letter **A** must come before **T**?\n\n> (Hint: The letters are C, A, T. Total arrangements without restriction? How many have A before T? How many have T before A?)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why this works:\n- Builds on the **same idea** as the first question: counting under a constraint.\n- Introduces a **symmetry pattern**: in any arrangement of two different letters, one comes before the other.\n- Encourages **reasoning** without formulas \u2014 you\u2019ll discover that exactly **half** of all arrangements have A before T.\n- Helps develop **pattern recognition** in combinatorics: *in random order, half the time A comes before T*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Suggested Discussion Prompt:\n> \"Why do you think exactly half the arrangements have A before T?
