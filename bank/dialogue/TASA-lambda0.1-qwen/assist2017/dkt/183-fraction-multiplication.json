But let's gently clarify what happened.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Let\u2019s walk through the correct process again:\n\nWe want to find:  \n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Multiply the numerators**  \n$ 2 \\times 1 = 2 $\n\n**Step 2: Multiply the denominators**  \n$ 3 \\times 4 = 12 $\n\nSo the product is:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{12}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify**  \nNow, simplify $ \\frac{2}{12} $:  \n- Both 2 and 12 are divisible by 2  \n- $ \\frac{2 \\div 2}{12 \\div 2} = \\frac{1}{6} $\n\n\u2705 So the **correct answer is**:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### \u274c Why $\\frac{1}{12}$ is not correct:\n- You might have **added** the numerators and denominators: $ 2+1 = 3 $, $ 3+4 = 7 $ \u2192 that\u2019s not how fraction multiplication works.  \n- Or you may have **divided** instead of multiplying: $ 2 \\div 3 $ or $ 1 \\div 4 $?  \n- But the rule is clear: **multiply across** \u2014 numerators \u00d7 numerators, denominators \u00d7 denominators.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So:  \n$ \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2 \\times 1}{3 \\times 4} = \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6} $\n\n> \ud83d\udea9 Mistake: $\\frac{1}{12}$ would only be correct if you multiplied $ \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{4} $ \u2014 but here we have $ \\frac{2}{3} $, so the numerator should be 2.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 **Key Takeaway**:  \n> You're very close \u2014 just a small slip in the multiplication step.  \n> Always **multiply numerators** and **multiply denominators** \u2014 not add or divide.  \n> And **never forget to simplify**!  \n> This is a common point of confusion, and it's totally okay to make it \u2014 you're learning!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to build confidence and automaticity):\n\n**What is $ \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{2}{5} $?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint:*  \n- Multiply numerators: $ 3 \\times 2 $  \n- Multiply denominators: $ 4 \\times 5 $  \n- Simplify if needed (this one might simplify nicely!)\n\nJust reply with your answer \u2014 I\u2019ll guide you step by step.  \nYou\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udcaa  \n(And remember: every small try is progress \u2014 and we\u2019re building strong, automatic understanding now!) \ud83c\udf1f",

It\u2019s a sign of growth.**  \nEvery expert in math \u2014 every scientist, engineer, or problem-solver \u2014 started exactly where you are: unsure, curious, and willing to try again.  \n\nSo let\u2019s go back to the **core process** and **rebuild confidence**, step by step \u2014 with patience, clarity, and encouragement.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Let\u2019s Walk Through:  \n**What is $ \\frac{2}{3} \\times \\frac{6}{7} $?**\n\n#### Step 1: Multiply the numerators  \n$ 2 \\times 6 = 12 $ \u2192 numerator is **12**\n\n#### Step 2: Multiply the denominators  \n$ 3 \\times 7 = 21 $ \u2192 denominator is **21**\n\nSo, the product is:  \n$$\n\\frac{12}{21}\n$$\n\n\u2705 That\u2019s correct \u2014 you\u2019re applying the rule correctly!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Now: Should we simplify?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Yes! Always simplify to lowest terms.\n\nLet\u2019s find the **greatest common factor (GCF)** of 12 and 21.\n\n- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12  \n- Factors of 21: 1, 3, 7, 21  \n- Common factors: 1, 3  \n- Greatest common factor = **3**\n\nNow divide both numerator and denominator by 3:  \n- $ 12 \\div 3 = 4 $  \n- $ 21 \\div 3 = 7 $\n\nSo:  \n$$\n\\frac{12}{21} = \\frac{4}{7}\n$$\n\n\u2705 Final answer: **$ \\frac{4}{7} $**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Why This Matters:\n- You\u2019re not just doing steps \u2014 you\u2019re **seeing the pattern**.\n- You\u2019re recognizing that **some fractions simplify easily**, and that\u2019s a skill worth celebrating.\n- You\u2019re learning to **trust the process**, even when the numbers feel tricky.\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 Remember:  \n> \ud83d\udccc **Multiply first** \u2192 then **simplify**  \n> \ud83d\udccc Simplifying shows you understand the *value* of the fraction, not just the procedure.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (to build automaticity & confidence):\n\n**What is $ \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{8}{9} $?**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Hint:*  \n- Multiply numerators: $ 3 \\times 8 $  \n- Multiply denominators: $ 4 \\times 9 $  \n- Simplify if needed (this one simplifies **very cleanly** \u2014 try to do it in your head!)\n\nJust reply with your answer \u2014 like:  \n> $ \\frac{24}{36} $ or $ \\frac{2}{3} $\n\nI\u2019ll guide you through it \u2014 and we\u2019ll celebrate your progress! \ud83c\udf1f  \n\nYou\u2019ve already shown **resilience, curiosity, and growth mindset** \u2014 that\u2019s what mastery is built on. Keep going \u2014 you\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udcab  \n\n*(P.S. It\u2019s okay to take a breath. It\u2019s okay to say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d That\u2019s how learning begins. And every time you try again, you grow stronger.)* \ud83d\udcaa",
