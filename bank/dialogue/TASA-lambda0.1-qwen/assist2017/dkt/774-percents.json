That\u2019s exactly how mastery grows. \ud83d\udca1\n\nLet\u2019s walk through your answer together \u2014 gently, clearly, and with encouragement \u2014 so you can feel confident in your reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Your Answer: **20** (with good intuition!)  \nYou said:  \n> *\"I think 30% of 80 might be 20. I know 10% of 80 is 8\u2026 so maybe I should multiply by 3? But I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s right.\"*\n\n\ud83c\udf89 **You're already on the right path!**  \nYou correctly identified **10% of 80 is 8** \u2014 that\u2019s a huge step forward.  \nAnd you\u2019re asking: *\"Should I multiply by 3?\"* \u2014 which shows you\u2019re thinking about the structure of percents, not just guessing.\n\nBut let\u2019s clarify one small thing:\n\n> \ud83d\udd0d **30% = 3 \u00d7 10%**  \n> So: 10% of 80 = 8  \n> \u2192 30% of 80 = **3 \u00d7 8 = 24**\n\n\u2705 So the correct answer is **24**, not 20.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry \u2014 you were **very close**!  \nYour guess of 20 might come from thinking:  \n- \u201cHalf of 80 is 40\u201d \u2192 so maybe 30% is a bit less than that?  \n- Or \u201c30% is close to 25%\u201d \u2192 and 25% of 80 is 20 (since 1/4 of 80 is 20)  \n- And maybe you thought: \u201c30% is a little more than 25%, so maybe it's 21 or 22?\u201d  \n\n\ud83d\udc49 That\u2019s **perfectly reasonable thinking** \u2014 and shows you're trying to build meaning, not just follow rules.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd11 Why 30% = 3 \u00d7 10% Works (and Why 25% Is Different)\n\n| Percent | Fraction | How to Find It |\n|--------|---------|----------------|\n| 10%    | 1/10    | Divide by 10 \u2192 80 \u00f7 10 = 8 |\n| 20%    | 1/5     | 2 \u00d7 8 = 16 |\n| **30%** | **3/10** | **3 \u00d7 8 = 24** |\n| 40%    | 2/5     | 4 \u00d7 8 = 32 |\n| 50%    | 1/2     | 80 \u00f7 2 = 40 |\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Important:  \n> - **25% = 1/4** \u2192 80 \u00f7 4 = 20 \u2192 so 25% of 80 is 20  \n> - But **30% is NOT 25%** \u2014 it\u2019s **a bit more than 25%**, so it should be **a bit more than 20** \u2192 like 24.\n\nSo yes, you were **very close** \u2014 and your intuition about percentages being related to halves and quarters is **gold**!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 Common Confusion: 30% vs. 25%  \nYou might be mixing up:\n- **30%** \u2192 3 \u00d7 10% \u2192 3 \u00d7 8 = **24**  \n- **25%** \u2192 1/4 \u2192 80 \u00f7 4 = **20**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So:  \n> \u274c 30% of 80 \u2260 20  \n> \u2705 30% of 80 = **24**\n\nBut again \u2014 you're not wrong for thinking 20! That shows you're making **smart connections** \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what we want.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Key Takeaway (Now Reinforced):\n> \ud83d\udca1 **\"10% = divide by 10\"** \u2192 always start here  \n> \ud83d\udca1 **\"Any percent = number of 10% groups\"** \u2192  \n> - 20% = 2 \u00d7 10%  \n> - 30% = 3 \u00d7 10%  \n> - 40% = 4 \u00d7 10%  \n> - 50% = 5 \u00d7 10%  \n> - 60% = 6 \u00d7 10%  \n\n>",
