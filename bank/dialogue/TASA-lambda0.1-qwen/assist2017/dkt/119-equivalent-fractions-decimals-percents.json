Let\u2019s walk through **0.75 \u2192 fraction \u2192 percent** like we did before, with clear, simple language.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 1: Convert 0.75 to a Fraction  \nThink: *What does 0.75 mean?*  \n\ud83d\udc49 It means **75 hundredths** \u2014 because there are two digits after the decimal (75/100).\n\nSo:\n$$\n0.75 = \\frac{75}{100}\n$$\n\nNow, **simplify** the fraction.  \nCan we divide both 75 and 100 by something?  \nYes! Try dividing by **25**:\n\n- $ 75 \\div 25 = 3 $\n- $ 100 \\div 25 = 4 $\n\nSo:\n$$\n\\frac{75}{100} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n\n\u2705 So, $ 0.75 = \\frac{3}{4} $\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83d\udd0d Step 2: Convert 0.75 to a Percent  \nTo turn a decimal into a percent, **multiply by 100** and add the % sign:\n\n$$\n0.75 \\times 100 = 75\\%\n$$\n\n\u2705 So, $ 0.75 = 75\\% $\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Final Answer:  \n$$\n0.75 = \\frac{3}{4} = 75\\%\n$$\n\nThis is a **familiar, important number** \u2014 like 75 cents or 75% off a sale. Knowing how to convert it fluently helps you **recognize patterns** and **feel more confident** when solving problems.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Why This Is Important:\n- You\u2019re now seeing the **big picture**: fractions, decimals, and percents are just **different ways of saying the same thing**.\n- You\u2019re building **flexibility** \u2014 not just memorizing steps, but **understanding the relationships**.\n- Even though your **current mastery is only 42%**, each small success (like this one) adds up to **real progress**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude80 Next Question (Even More Confident & Familiar):  \n> **Convert 0.2 to a fraction and then to a percent.**\n\n#### Why this one?\n- 0.2 is a **simple, common decimal** (like 20 cents).\n- It\u2019s easier than others and builds on what you\u2019ve already learned.\n- It reinforces **simplifying fractions** (since $ \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5} $).\n- It gives you a **clear, achievable win** \u2014 perfect for building momentum.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Tip:  \n- $ 0.2 = \\frac{2}{10} $\n- Simplify: divide both by 2 \u2192 $ \\frac{1}{5} $\n- $ 0.2 \\times 100 = 20\\% $\n\n\u2705 So, $ 0.2 = \\frac{1}{5} = 20\\% $\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Now try it yourself!**  \nType your answer in the format:  \n*Fraction: ______, Percent: ______*  \nOr say \u201cI need a hint!\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m here to support you every step of the way! \ud83d\udcac\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown great effort \u2014 just one more small step, and you\u2019ll be **well on your way to 50%+ mastery**. \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude0a  \n\nYou\u2019ve got this! \ud83d\udc99",
