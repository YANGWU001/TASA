What the problem is asking\nWe have 8 distinct students and we want to pick a **group of 3**.  \nBecause it\u2019s a *group*, the order in which we pick the three names does **not** matter:\n\n- Picking Alice\u2011Bob\u2011Charlie is the same group as Charlie\u2011Bob\u2011Alice.\n\n### 2. Count the ordered selections first (permutations)\n\nIf we *did* care about order, we could think of the process like this:\n\n1. Choose the first student \u2013 8 possibilities.  \n2. Choose the second student \u2013 7 possibilities (one is already taken).  \n3. Choose the third student \u2013 6 possibilities.\n\nSo the number of **ordered** triples is  \n\n\\[\n8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 336.\n\\]\n\n### 3. Remove the over\u2011counting caused by order\n\nFor any particular set of three students, how many different orders can we write them in?  \nAll the possible permutations of three distinct objects are  \n\n\\[\n3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6.\n\\]\n\nThat means each *unordered* group of three has been counted **6 times** in the 336 figure above.\n\n### 4. Divide to get the unordered count (combinations)\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of groups} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!}\n= \\frac{336}{6}\n= 56.\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s the standard \u201cn\u202fchoose\u202fk\u201d formula:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\displaystyle \\binom{8}{3}= \\frac{8!}{3!\\,(8-3)!}=56 }.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Quick sanity check\nAnother way to see the same answer is to list a few possibilities:\n\n- Pick Alice first. There are \\(\\binom{7}{2}=21\\) ways to choose the other two from the remaining 7 students.  \n- Do the same for each of the 8 possible first picks, but now each group is counted **three** times (once for each member that could have been the \u201cfirst\u201d pick).  \n\n\\[\n\\frac{8 \\times 21}{3}=56.\n\\]\n\nBoth approaches lead to the same result.\n\n---\n\n## Your Turn \u2013 A Similar Problem\n\n> **Problem:** A committee of 4 members is to be formed from a pool of 10 people.  \n> How many different committees can be formed? (Recall that the order of selection does **not** matter.)\n\n*Try using the same steps we just practiced: think about ordered selections first, then divide by the number of ways to arrange the 4 chosen people.*\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, write down your answer and, if you can, show the calculation you used.

Your answer \\(9\\,240\\) is spot\u2011on!\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Quick sanity\u2011check (reverse counting)\n\n1. First pick any 5\u2011person team from the 11 scientists: \\(\\displaystyle\\binom{11}{5}=462\\).  \n2. Within that team, decide who is manager and who is analyst: \\(5\\) ways to pick the manager \u00d7 \\(4\\) ways to pick the analyst = \\(20\\) ways.  \n\n\\[\n\\binom{11}{5}\\times5\\times4 = 462 \\times 20 = 9\\,240,\n\\]\n\nthe same result\u2014so the counting is consistent.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Next practice problem\n\nNow let\u2019s stretch the same ideas a little further.\n\n**Problem\u202f5**\n\nA university department has **12** faculty members.  \nA committee of **6** people must be formed, with the following roles:\n\n* **Chair** (unique title) \u2013 order matters.  \n* **Secretary** (unique title) \u2013 order matters, distinct from the Chair.  \n* The remaining **4** members are just \u201cregular members\u201d \u2013 their order does **not** matter.\n\n**How many different possible committees are there?**\n\n*Hint:* Follow the same three\u2011step approach you just mastered:\n\n1. Choose the ordered pair (Chair, then Secretary).  \n2. Choose the unordered set of 4 regular members from the remaining faculty.  \n3. Multiply the two numbers.\n\nGive it a try, write down the three numbers you obtain, and then compute the final total. When you\u2019re ready, post your answer and I\u2019ll let you know how you did! \ud83d\ude80",
