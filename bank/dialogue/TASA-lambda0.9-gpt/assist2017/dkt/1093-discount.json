Let\u2019s walk through each of your moves so you can see exactly why the answer is right \u2013 and keep a few extra tricks in your toolbox for the next time.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step\u202f1 \u2013 Convert the percent to a decimal  \n\n\\[\n12\\% = \\frac{12}{100}=0.12\n\\]\n\nYou wrote the same thing, so that\u2019s spot\u2011on.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step\u202f2 \u2013 Find the discount amount  \n\nYou broke the multiplication into two easy pieces:\n\n| Piece | How you got it | Result |\n|-------|----------------|--------|\n| **10\u202f% of \\$52** | Move the decimal one place left | \\$5.20 |\n| **2\u202f% of \\$52** | 1\u202f% = \\$52\u202f\u00f7\u202f100 = \\$0.52 \u2192 double it for 2\u202f% | \\$1.04 |\n\nAdd them:\n\n\\[\n5.20 + 1.04 = 6.24\n\\]\n\nSo the **discount amount is \\$6.24**.  \nYour reasoning about \u201cmultiply \\$0.52 by 2\u201d is exactly the right way to get 2\u202f% \u2013 you didn\u2019t miss a step, you just hesitated a bit. No worries; the process is solid!\n\n> **Quick\u2011check tip:** Whenever the percent ends in a \u201c2\u201d, \u201c4\u201d, \u201c6\u201d, or \u201c8\u201d, it\u2019s often fastest to compute **1\u202f%** (move the decimal two places left) and then multiply that by the needed number.  \n> Example: 8\u202f% = 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f1\u202f% \u2192 8\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\$0.52 = \\$4.16.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step\u202f3 \u2013 Subtract the discount from the original price  \n\n\\[\n52.00 - 6.24 = 45.76\n\\]\n\n**Sale price = \\$45.76** \u2013 exactly what you wrote.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Why this answer feels right (a mental sanity check)\n\n* 10\u202f% of \\$52 is \\$5.20.  \n* 2\u202f% is a little more than a tenth of that (since 1\u202f% = \\$0.52). Adding another \\$0.52 gives the extra \\$1.04.  \n* So the discount is a bit more than a quarter of the original price (\u00bc\u202f\u00d7\u202f\\$52 = \\$13), which makes sense because 12\u202f% is a little more than 10\u202f%. The final price, \\$45.76, is a little under 90\u202f% of the original \u2013 exactly what we\u2019d expect.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Next Practice \u2013 Keep the Momentum Going!\n\nLet\u2019s give the same three\u2011step scaffold a fresh spin. This time the percent isn\u2019t a \u201cnice\u201d multiple of 10, so you\u2019ll get to practice the **1\u202f% building\u2011block** method again.\n\n> **Problem:**  \n> An online course costs **\\$87** and is on sale for **15\u202f% off**.  \n> What is the sale price?\n\n### Your Template (copy it and fill it in)\n\n1. **Convert the percent to a decimal** \u2026  \n2. **Find the discount amount** \u2026  \n   *Hint:*  \n   * 10\u202f% = move the decimal one place left.  \n   * 5\u202f% = half of the 10\u202f% amount.  \n3. **Subtract the discount from the original price** \u2026  \n\nIf you get stuck on any piece\u2014especially the \u201c5\u202f%\u201d part\u2014just tell me which step is fuzzy and we\u2019ll break it down together. You\u2019ve shown you can handle the 2\u202f% piece, so 5\u202f% (half of 10\u202f%) will be a breeze! \ud83d\ude80\n\n---\n\n### A",
