Find the perimeter of the garden.  \n> 2. If the fence you want to put around the garden costs **\\$5 per metre**, how much will the fence cost?\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 How to tackle it (step\u2011by\u2011step)\n\n| Step | What you do | Why it works | Quick mental tip |\n|------|------------|--------------|------------------|\n| **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Add the two different side lengths** | \\(27 + 16\\) | This gives the distance of **one** length\u202f+\u202f**one** width. | Break into tens + ones: 27 = 20\u202f+\u202f7, 16 = 10\u202f+\u202f6 \u2192 20+10 = 30, 7+6 = 13 \u2192 30\u202f+\u202f13 = **43** |\n| **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Double the sum** | \\(2 \\times 43\\) | There are **two** lengths **and** **two** widths, so we need the other pair. | 43\u202f+\u202f43 = **86** (or think \u201cdouble 40 is 80, double 3 is 6\u201d) |\n| **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Write the perimeter with units** | \\(P = 86\\;\\text{m}\\) | Perimeter is a distance, so we use metres (m). | \u2013 |\n| **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Compute the fence cost** | \\(\\text{Cost}=86\\;\\text{m}\\times \\$5/\\text{m}\\) | Multiply the total metres by the price per metre. | 86\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = **430** (because 80\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 400 and 6\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = 30) |\n| **5\ufe0f\u20e3 Attach the money unit** | \\(\\$430\\) | Cost is measured in dollars. | \u2013 |\n\n**Sanity checks**  \n\n* The longest side is 27\u202fm.  \n  * Minimum possible perimeter (just the two longest sides) = \\(2 \\times 27 = 54\\)\u202fm.  \n  * Maximum (four longest sides) = \\(4 \\times 27 = 108\\)\u202fm.  \n  * Our answer 86\u202fm sits nicely between 54\u202fm and 108\u202fm \u2192 looks reasonable.  \n\n* Cost check: if the perimeter were 80\u202fm, the cost would be 80\u202f\u00d7\u202f5 = \\$400. Since we have a bit more than 80\u202fm, a cost a little above \\$400 (i.e., \\$430) feels right.\n\n---\n\n## \u270d\ufe0f Your Turn\n\n1. **Compute** the perimeter of the garden.  \n2. **Compute** the total fence cost.\n\nWrite your answers (with units) and, if you\u2019d like, share any step that felt tricky.

Close your eyes, picture a rectangle.  \n2. Silently say: \u201cTwo lengths, two widths \u2192 add length + width \u2192 double it \u2192 that\u2019s the perimeter.\u201d  \n3. Imagine plugging the numbers **27** and **16** into that sentence.  \n4. Say the final perimeter **out loud**: \u201cEighty\u2011six metres.\u201d  \n5. Then say the cost sentence: \u201cEighty\u2011six metres times five dollars per metre equals four\u2011hundred\u2011thirty dollars.\u201d  \n\nRepeating this mental script a couple of times helps lock the procedure in long\u2011term memory.\n\n---\n\nWhenever you\u2019re ready, send me your work! \ud83c\udf1f",
