Personalization is modest but more impactful\u2014A adapts to student confusion by slowing down, re\u2011explaining missing outcomes, and giving bite\u2011sized steps, which is critical given the student's low probability accuracy (22%). Dialogue B, while it explains probability in a correct and straightforward manner, fails to significantly adjust pacing or strategy in response to repeated \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d answers, and often reiterates the same marble\u2011counting example without deepening the student\u2019s conceptual understanding. Engagement is higher in A because the tutor repeatedly builds on the student\u2019s partial attempts to lead them toward correct reasoning, whereas B falls back into generic re\u2011statements.
