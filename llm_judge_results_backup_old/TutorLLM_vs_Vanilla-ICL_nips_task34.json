It repeatedly reinforces the \"fold-and-match\" concept and makes corrections in a supportive way, which helps the student refine their mental model.

The tutor spends significant time on meta\u2011feedback (e.g., sentence completion habits) without getting the student to clearly execute all triangle construction steps. While the instructional quality is decent and explanations are generally accurate, the guidance is fragmented, slowing progress. Personalization is minimal; it doesn\u2019t explicitly connect the teaching to the student\u2019s known weaknesses (e.g., geometric basics, construction skills) in a targeted way.  \nDialogue B, while still iterative and partially incomplete, maintains a clearer, step\u2011by\u2011step instructional focus on triangle construction. The tutor pushes the student to identify given data, choose appropriate tools, and outline the correct sequence of actions. There is less drift into extra issues, and the tutor repeatedly reinforces core procedural knowledge for SAS construction, improving efficiency. Although personalization is still generic, the more direct scaffolding leads to better clarity and potential learning gains for this student.  \nGiven the student\u2019s \u201cneeds improvement\u201d in construct triangle, Dialogue B\u2019s more structured prompting supports clearer understanding and is more efficient, so it has the edge.\n\n**Instructional Quality: A [6/10], B [7/10]**  \n**Personalization Impact: A [4/10], B [5/10]**  \n**Overall Score: A [6/10], B [7/10]**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

Dialogue B, while straightforward and repeated in structure, mostly gives generic corrections about area of a square without adapting to the student's profile or addressing related weak areas.
