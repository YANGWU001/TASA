    "prompt": "Suggest a good camera angle for an emotional scene.",
    "response": "A close-up shot is a great camera angle for an emotional scene. By focusing tightly on a character’s face, a close-up captures subtle expressions—tears, trembling lips, searching eyes—that convey deep emotion. This angle draws the audience into the character’s internal world, making the moment more intimate and powerful.\n\nFor even greater impact, you can use an **extreme close-up** to highlight a specific detail (like a teardrop or clenched hands), or a **slightly high angle** to make the character appear vulnerable. Don’t forget to keep the background minimal to maintain focus on the emotion.\n\nIn summary:  \n- **Close-up** for facial expression and intensity  \n- **Extreme close-up** for key details  \n- **High angle** for vulnerability\n\nThese choices help the audience connect emotionally with the character and the scene."

    "prompt": "Explain general relativity in simple terms.",
    "response": "General relativity is a theory of gravity developed by Albert Einstein. Here’s a simple way to understand it:\n\n**Gravity is not just a force pulling things together.**  \nInstead, think of the universe as a giant stretchy fabric called \"spacetime.\" Objects like the Sun and planets sit on this fabric and create dents or curves in it—like how a heavy ball placed on a trampoline makes a dip.\n\n**Smaller objects, like the Earth or a ball, roll toward heavier objects because of these curves.**  \nSo, when Earth orbits the Sun, it’s really following the curved path in the space created by the Sun’s mass.\n\n**In short:**  \nMassive things bend space and time, and gravity is how we experience this bending.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Matter tells spacetime how to curve.\n- Curved spacetime tells matter how to move.\n\nThis is why, in Einstein’s view, gravity isn’t just pulling things together; it’s the natural movement of objects along the curved paths in spacetime created by mass and energy."

    "prompt": "What makes a great short film script?",
    "response": "A great short film script stands out through its ability to tell a powerful, engaging story within a limited timeframe. Here are some key elements that contribute to a great short film script:\n\n**1. Focused Concept**  \nA single, strong idea or premise is the foundation. Because time is limited, a short film works best when it explores one central concept or question, rather than multiple subplots.\n\n**2. Compelling Characters**  \nEven in a few pages, audiences should be able to connect with the protagonist. Great short scripts give their characters clear desires, obstacles, and stakes—even if these are small and subtle.\n\n**3. Visual Storytelling**  \nFilm is a visual medium. A great short makes every image count and often \"shows\" rather than \"tells.\" Dialogue is minimal and purposeful; much of the story unfolds through actions, expressions, and cinematic detail.\n\n**4. Economical Structure**  \nMost short films follow a simplified version of the three-act structure: setup, confrontation, and resolution—often compressed or implied. Every scene and line should serve the central idea and move the story forward.\n\n**5. Intriguing Hook and Memorable Ending**  \nStarting with an attention-grabbing hook draws the audience in quickly. A strong ending—whether it's a twist, an emotional payoff, or a lingering question—leaves a lasting impression.\n\n**6. Theme or Emotional Core**  \nThe best short scripts resonate because they tap into a universal theme or evoke real emotion, even if the story is simple. There's often an underlying message or \"something to say.\"\n\n**7. Creative Constraints**  \nShorts often shine when they embrace their constraints—using minimal settings, characters, or dialogue in inventive ways rather than trying to mimic features.\n\n**8. Rewatch Value**  \nThe most memorable shorts offer something for the audience to think about or revisit, whether it’s a clever structure, surprising ending, or layered visuals.\n\n**In summary:**  \nA great short film script is clear, concise, and impactful. It focuses on a compelling idea, creates emotional engagement, and makes every word and image count.\n\nWould you like an example or tips on writing your own short script?"
