Although the session drifts to a tangential topic about cat purring, the initial approach attempts to adapt to the student's learning style rather than sticking to a rigid format. In contrast, Dialogue B is highly procedural and generic: it provides repeated fraction\u2011decimal\u2011percent practice with standard hints and feedback, but no tailoring to this student's specific profile, past struggles, or preferred methods. Dialogue B keeps the math focus but does not connect to strengths/weaknesses or personal interests, making it less adaptive. Therefore, while both have shortcomings in leveraging the student's documented performance history, Dialogue A\u2019s explicit tailoring to stated learning preferences gives it the edge.\n\n**Personalization Score A: 6/10**  \n**Personalization Score B: 3/10**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

The tutor repeatedly connects the student\u2019s statements (like mixing up 360\u00b0 for a triangle) to related concepts the student already knows, and uses \u201cbridge\u2011building\u201d to strengthen understanding. It adapts the pace and detail to the student\u2019s stuck points, providing visual proof strategies and concrete examples to clear confusion. In contrast, Dialogue B mostly presents generic practice problems with the same procedural steps and correction for arithmetic or misreading, without referencing the student\u2019s specific misconceptions beyond catching arithmetic errors. While B offers repetition and hints, it lacks deeper adaptation to the student\u2019s misunderstandings and doesn\u2019t leverage their thinking history.

The tutor acknowledges \"I don't know\" as a legitimate starting point and adjusts by further simplifying and rephrasing the problem into more accessible sub\u2011questions, which is more responsive to the student\u2019s repeated blanks. Dialogue B, in contrast, largely repeats the same procedural \u201cmultiply by the reciprocal\u201d explanation with different word problems, treating \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses as simply incorrect and moving through similar fraction\u2011division problems without modifying the approach or introducing alternative representations. This shows less adaptation to the student\u2019s demonstrated difficulty \u2014 it remains generic procedural instruction.
