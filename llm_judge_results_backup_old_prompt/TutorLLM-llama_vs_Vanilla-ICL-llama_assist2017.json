The tutor occasionally tailors advice (\"Considering your strengths in division with decimals\") and offers step-by-step breakdowns that revisit fundamental concepts, showing awareness of past mistakes (e.g., the repeated confusion between 0.25 and 25%). In contrast, Dialogue B largely presents generic problems without integrating insights from the student's learning history or systematically addressing specific misconceptions observed earlier. While both dialogues repeat concepts and attempt corrective feedback, A\u2019s feedback more often connects to the student's profile and tries to build bridges across weak skill domains. B\u2019s approach remains mostly procedural and situational without deeper tailoring to this student's broader challenges or past attempts.\n\n**Personalization Score A: 6/10**  \n**Personalization Score B: 3/10**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

While the attempts to tie in \u201carea\u201d and other weak topics sometimes meander, they nonetheless show awareness of the student\u2019s broader profile. Dialogue B, while containing correct explanations, is far more generic and uses \u201cstory\u201d contexts without directly connecting to this student's past mistakes or strengths; it does not leverage any of the extensive performance history, nor does it adapt instruction significantly in response to repeated uncertainty.

Although the explanations sometimes become repetitive and occasionally unfocused, they nonetheless attempt to tailor the session to the student's learning gaps. In contrast, Dialogue B mainly provides generic fraction-to-decimal-to-percent conversion questions with real-world flavor (pizza, bike ride) but does not meaningfully leverage the detailed accuracy statistics or past difficulties. Dialogue B fails to connect to the student's broader learning context and does not adapt based on repeated \"I don't know\" responses beyond restating the process, making it more generic and less responsive to this student's specific patterns.\n\n**Personalization Score A: 6/10**  \n**Personalization Score B: 3/10**\n\n**Confidence: High**"
