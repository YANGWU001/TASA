      "judgment": "**Winner: Dialogue A**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nDialogue A shows substantially more personalization to the individual student\u2019s learning profile. The tutor repeatedly acknowledges the student's meta-cognitive behaviors (e.g., starting sentences but not finishing), connects these moments to learning strategies, and reinforces the student's earlier mention of \"chunking\" for handling difficult numbers. It adapts explanations to the student's needs, such as breaking large numbers into place-value chunks and suggesting specific reflection prompts (\u201cWhat\u2019s the next word that would finish my idea?\u201d), which align with the student\u2019s 40% accuracy in \"Using difficult numbers\" and difficulties with maintaining thought completion. In contrast, Dialogue B is largely generic: while it does explain how to convert mixed numbers/decimals and use the Pythagorean theorem, it never references this student's strengths (like mastery in combining like terms or removing coefficients) or known weaknesses beyond generic comments about difficult numbers. Dialogue B's tasks could apply to any learner without tailoring to this one\u2019s behavioral patterns or partial successes. Therefore, A better adapts both the content and the motivational feedback to the student's specific tendencies.\n\n**Personalization Score A: 7/10**  \n**Personalization Score B: 4/10**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

      "judgment": "**Winner: Dialogue A**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nDialogue A consistently references the student's specific strengths and weaknesses, pulling in past mastery (e.g., mentioning the student's proficiency with \"Isolate x\" rules and issues with handling units) and integrating those into the teaching flow. The tutor connects the current \"Find X@@@@ Simple\" tasks to related mastered skills (isolate positive/negative coefficient cases) and known struggles (keeping track of units, entering given values). This shows awareness of the student profile and uses it to guide explanations and next steps.  \nDialogue B, while it provides structured, clear guidance, treats the student's \"I don't know\" responses generically without tying feedback to their known skill gaps or strengths. It walks through examples and general equation-solving steps without leveraging the student's record of unit handling or specific coefficient struggles. The lack of targeted connection makes it less personalized compared to Dialogue A's approach, which weaves in the student's history and meta-cognitive strategies.  \n\n**Personalization Score A: 8/10**  \n**Personalization Score B: 5/10**\n\n**Confidence: High**"
