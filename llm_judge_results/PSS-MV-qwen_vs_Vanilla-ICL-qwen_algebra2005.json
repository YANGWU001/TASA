The tutor repeatedly has the student *do* concrete problem-solving steps, encourages them to explain their thinking, and adapts tasks to keep them in a comfort zone while gradually extending to slightly harder equations. In contrast, Dialogue B remains largely generic, focusing on simple arithmetic without leveraging the student's strengths or addressing their weaknesses directly.
