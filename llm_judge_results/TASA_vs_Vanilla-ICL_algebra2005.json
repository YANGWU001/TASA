Dialogue B, while simpler, operates at an overly basic addition/subtraction level far below the student\u2019s mathematical profile, offering little challenge or connection to their actual needs. B's feedback is accurate but generic, and its personalization does not leverage the specific skill deficits in algebraic problem solving. Overall, A aligns with the student's needs, addresses misconceptions repeatedly, and maintains appropriate pacing for remediation, whereas B fails to engage with the relevant skill area.\n\n**Instructional Quality: A [9/10], B [5/10]**  \n**Personalization Impact: A [8/10], B [3/10]**  \n**Overall Score: A [8.6/10], B [4.6/10]**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

Its personalization is weak\u2014errors are handled generically, and it doesn\u2019t adapt pacing or difficulty to this student\u2019s issue (and, in fact, the focus on addition is misaligned with the greater subtraction difficulty noted in the profile).
