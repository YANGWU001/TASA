The scaffolding is consistent: the tutor cycles through similar problems, giving immediate feedback that attacks the student\u2019s exact misunderstanding (confusing factors/multiples), which addresses a known weakness in the student profile (\u201cIdentify LCM \u2013 one number multiple of other\u201d at 38% accuracy). While it is verbose, the repetition here is purposeful and keeps the focus on a single conceptual hurdle until the student can grasp it. Dialogue B, in contrast, is almost entirely generic and stagnates \u2014 the student repeatedly says \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and the tutor gives the same stock feedback without adjusting strategy or breaking down the reasoning further; there is no escalation or alternate approach to engage the student.
