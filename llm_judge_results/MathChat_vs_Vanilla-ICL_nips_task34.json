It scaffolds effectively by breaking down each factorization step and correcting partial errors with explicit reasoning, which directly addresses the student's confusion.

Dialogue B\u2019s repeated practice questions with well\u2011structured hints promote better retention and procedural fluency for this student, who struggles in Prime Numbers & Prime Factors. Dialogue A\u2019s explanations are verbose and fragmented, with excessive generic meta\u2011strategy guidance that doesn\u2019t adapt to this student\u2019s known weaknesses or push them through concrete examples efficiently.
