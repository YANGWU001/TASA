It repeatedly checks the student's arithmetic and dimensional accuracy, scaffolding from simpler to slightly more complex examples, which is particularly important for this student with a low perimeter accuracy rate (33%). While Dialogue A is somewhat verbose, the repetition here reinforces the correct procedure and addresses observed misconceptions (like forgetting to double length+width). Dialogue B, although encouraging, allows arithmetic and conceptual errors to persist longer and sometimes validates incorrect reasoning without fully unpacking the mistake until later.
