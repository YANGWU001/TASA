It responds to the student\u2019s repeated \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d with visual suggestions (sketching), concrete mini\u2011steps, and explanations of common mistakes \u2014 all of which are appropriate given the profile\u2019s 40% accuracy in perimeter and visual\u2011spatial weaknesses in geometric properties. While A is verbose, it adapts its approach by linking perimeter to area and percent\u2011of problems, targeting multiple weak areas, thus meaningfully personalizing content to improve transfer of knowledge. Dialogue\u202fB delivers correct formulas and practice questions but cycles through similar low\u2011engagement corrections, marking \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d as incorrect without scaffolding underlying strategy; personalization is minimal and mostly generic repetition.

Personalization is used meaningfully: references to the student's prior struggles with order of operations and pattern finding are tied into actionable advice for isolating variables.  \nDialogue B, while systematic in prompting the setup of equations from word problems, mostly cycles through \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d responses without moving the student toward an actual solution. It repeats the translation step without deepening conceptual understanding or breaking down the barrier causing paralysis, and there\u2019s minimal direct adjustment to match the student\u2019s severe difficulties with basic equation mechanics. Thus, A produces a stronger learning outcome for this student.\n\n**Instructional Quality: A [8/10], B [5/10]**  \n**Personalization Impact: A [7/10], B [4/10]**  \n**Overall Score: A [8/10], B [5/10]**\n\n**Confidence: High**"

A's personalization is subtle but impactful\u2014it references the student's prior strengths (addition, multiplication) to frame the lesson, and contrasts these with weaknesses to adjust teaching steps.
