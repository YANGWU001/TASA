It uses a clear, repetitive structure: identify the symbol after the number, name it correctly, and discriminate between similar units (g vs. kg vs. mg). This directly targets the confusion shown in the student's incorrect answers and gives immediate, precise corrective feedback. Dialogue A mixes unit identification with multiplication practice\u2014adding complexity that conflicts with the student's stated weaknesses (the multiplication errors dilute focus on unit identification). While Dialogue A references other student weaknesses and includes some scaffolding, the adaptation is superficial; the repeated multiplication problems do not directly address the unit-identification gap and cost instructional efficiency. Dialogue B\u2019s simplicity, targeted repetition, and symbol-based cues demonstrably help the student learn *this* concept more effectively.  \n\n**Instructional Quality: A [6/10], B [8/10]**  \n**Personalization Impact: A [5/10], B [8/10]**  \n**Overall Score: A [5.5/10], B [8/10]**  \n\n**Confidence: High**"
